Bought it obviously because I have tape cassette's with no way to play them.<br />Spent an AMAZING afternoon, listening to my Mom (who passed away in 2005), tell a 90 minute Christmas story of &#34;Nicholas&#34;,  to my two daughters, many moons ago.

B00H8PI78C,15Pcs DC 5V 85dB 2 Pins Industrial Active Electronic Alarm Buzzer,Mobile_Electronics,3,"If what you want is a continuous tone piezo - i.e. a &#34;beeper&#34; - then this one would get 5  or maybe 4 stars.  (Possibly dock one star because it's a bit quiet for the rated sound level.)  However, if what you wanted was the thing described in the listing - i.e. a *buzzer*, for example something that would make the sound you get if you answer incorrectly on a game show &#34;bzzzzt&#34; - then it's 3 stars at best.  This is the 3rd batch of &#34;buzzers&#34; I've ordered from different suppliers so this is not an isolated incident.  Anyone need some beepers, cheap?"

B00KW3XNUE,Magicfly Wireless RF Item Locator Key Finder 1 RF Transmitter and 6 Receivers,Mobile_Electronics,2,"Just arrived,  read instructions and attacked my #1 to key chain. Installed battery but for the life of me, was unable to CLOSE the cap. 100 times and still no go. #1 is out and apparently is broken. Tried #2 and did mange to close the cap. Have not tried #3 or #4 yet. Surely they can make a quality cover for the device. Thinking of returning the item and look for better quality battery cover. The font on the instructions are  too tiny to read, sure you can afford a larger print. No phone number or web address to contact for a replacement of #1. Hmmm...maybe you KNEW you had an inferior battery cover and  didn't care to deal with the complaints!"

I am an african american and anyone with a television knows that racial profiling of minorities is a huge problem in America. I got my dash cam to record my trips but I also use it to record any police stops. So far no stops. Yay me BUT I took the scenic route to the beach and pointed my camera at the ocean as I drove. Beautiful. The video is crystal clear and vivid. I like it so much my husband wants one too. I recieved this dash cam at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of how well it performed.

B00LHXWPI4,Supersonic SC-807 Bluetooth CD/MP3/Cassette Player,Mobile_Electronics,1,"I was excited to get this product because it looked versatile and cute and I thought I could take it with me on the road.  However, after receiving it and trying it out I was disappointed to say the least.  The volume button does not work at all.  It is really stiff and difficult to move manually.  The control works, but it is small and could get lost if one is not careful.  The capacity for sound is limited.  Also the cables to connect the speakers were flimsy and not working properly.  Overall very disappointed with this purchase.  I contacted amazon for return and found out that we are responsible for shipping costs with this seller. I Found out the cheapest UPS ground services to be after packaging close to $30.00! This is crazy to have to pay this for a defective product.  So save your money and headache and buy something else.  Trust me, I hate to give bad reviews, but this is a sound equipment that you should skip!"

B00Z0GRGFG,Generic Mobile NL-550-WHITE Transceiver Antenna,Mobile_Electronics,1,"First off, we need the operating band this is designed for.  It is not foldable or collapsable.  Also need the connector type.<br />You will not sell many of these without supplying more information."
B00JP7TCDK,EC TECHNOLOGY? New design Backup External Battery Pack and Charger (Power Bank) with flashlight,Mobile_Electronics,5,"I bought this primarily to be used as a flashlight and it has worked out well over the last five weeks. I've run it for twenty hours continuously before deciding it was starting to dim. The nice thing about LEDs is the light stays white unlike a filament-type bulb. The light from this device is more than adequate when I'm out on a dark night. Then my phone charger replenishes it once it runs down. The flashlight switch does stick up just a little bit so it is possible for it to be inadvertently switched on (push-on/push-off) while in a pocket or pack.<br /><br />For recharging purposes, the battery capacity in this device is small. Although the battery capacity is spec'd at 2600 MaH, you will never get that amount into the device you are charging. The process of up-converting the charger's battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) to the USB standard (5 vdc) and back down to battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) in the device being charged results in some losses. A good budgetary figure is to plan on transferring 70% of the source battery capacity into the device being charged. So if your phone's battery is spec'd at 2500 MaH, you will need at least a 3600MaH battery in your charger to fully charge the phone's battery. This is true for all battery-driven chargers, not just this one. Or you can shop for a charger whose battery capacity is 150% of the device you need to fully charge - it's that simple."

This was much smaller that I thought, but the smaller the better, can't be seen easily by others.  I live in the city, lots of cars, stop lights and traffic.  Though I have not had accident since having installed this, I have reviewed footage and image was super clear for daytime video and better that I expected, very clear night vision.  I can see how this dashcam can come in handy for so many instances that could happen.  It was easy to install, we used a silicone adhesive for that extra security.  I think this dashcam is a good buy and I think everyone should have one these days.  I was able to try this at a discount for my honest review."

I have an MP3 player I bought elsewhere but this one looked a lot nicer than mine.  My friend loved her gift.  She thought I spent a lot of money on it but really, the price was very reasonable."

B011NH6I18,USTEK&reg; GPS Sun Shade Glare Shield Sun Visor Screen Protector for Universal Car GPS Applicable for Most Sedans and SUVs,Mobile_Electronics,3,"I'm not sure what the use case is for this device. A build-in, dash-mounted display is generally pretty well shielded from glare by virtue of its location. A GPS on top of the dashboard and closer to the windshield may suffer from glare problems, but this sunshade needs to be taped to the GPS to stay in place. Overall, I would say this is a solution in search of a problem, overpriced for what it actually does.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received an evaluation unit in exchange for a fair and honest review."

B00SU7B0JK,iXCC Multi pack Lightning cable,Mobile_Electronics,1,"I've bought a lot of products on Amazon...like we purchase several times a week.  In most cases, we get what we expect.  I was skeptical in purchasing these and saw mixed reviews, but these guys claim to be &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; and are &#34;genuine&#34;.  Well...BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />I purchases these in early July, one for each vehicle so we can keep our phones charged.  I bought them when I did because we were going to take a family trip and I wanted to have something in the car to keep devices charged on the go.  I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but other cables I've used in the same way (especially the one that came with my iPhone 5c) have worked WITHOUT ISSUE.  Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.  I highly recommend to keep looking and steer clear of these guys.  The worst part now, is that I have passed the one month window to return these because once back from my trip, I've had to deal with some work emergencies.  So I've basically just wasted my hard earned money on garbage, with no more option for refund."

But the vox gain is not sensitive enough to hear her until she is really mad. Even after buying the cable and adjusting the vox gain to the max. So it didn't work for that.

The video is clear and the mirror is fairly easy to install.  It has lots of features such as long battery life, motion sensor video mode, gps hook up (if you have your own) and plenty of options.  There are some issues though: (1) if you already have a large rear view mirror the placement of the camera lens may not allow you to position it correctly in your case; (2) the power cord is a bit shorter than other mirror cams that I own - barely reaches around the edges of my 07 Equinox; (3) basically no manual - and any English is a bit difficult to get - requires about 30 minutes of hunting and pecking through the menu and you will find it has lots of features;  (4) the screen is brighter than most but the coating on the reflective surface is a slightly different color than the screen really take some getting used if you look into your mirrors often; (5) has a super bright LED that blinks every other second.  During the night it lightens up my whole SUV - I put a sticker over it now it seems.  I have hooked up the included rear view cam, but looks pretty standard.  Overall though I am pretty pleased with this mirror and recommend that everyone have one if for nothing else other than an insurance policy."

Pairing was simple, just plugged it in and my phone connected to it on the first try. Haven't tried the NFC functionality due to my phone's current rom having it disabled, but I'm sure it works fine.

As soon as I plug it into my iPhone, it recognizes the charger instantly and begins charging immediately. No need to wiggle the cable around the port to get it to fit properly or for the device to pick it up. I actually think it works better than the charger my iphone came with! I've had it for over a year now and the wire is still in excellent shape. No tears to the cable, like you often have with apple headphones or other chargers, plus the wire is still neat and clean hasn't really accumulated any dirt or smudges (I bought the white one so that says a lot). The cable also stays straight, i.e. it also doesn't tangle or twist into a knot that you need to untangle. Whether you're looking for a primary iphone charger or a secondary charging cable for your car or for traveling, this product gets the job done!<br /><br />Overall, a great item at a great price (no need to overpay at the Apple store).

The body is a mixture of silicone rubber and high density plastic, with metal grills on the front, and a rubber strap for carrying.<br /><br />Outdoors, it won't scare away the livestock or set off seismic activity sensors but is perfect for a tent or a small room. As an added bonus you can insert a micro hard drive on the back and play your music directly from that, so it technically qualifies as an MP3 player, albeit one with minimal controls.

B0067XVNTG,"Generic Car Dashboard Video Camera Vehicle Video Accident Recorder (2.0"" 1080P)",Mobile_Electronics,3,"Alright, so I wasn't expecting much. That's okay because I'm putting this in my old Chevy pickup and if it gets stolen some day I didn't want to be out a bunch of money. The camera works. Now, here's my only complaint so far - this is quite possibly the most unbelievably bad manual I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad it's actually funny. The camera has three modes: video (called &#34;shooting&#34;), photos, and File management (playback). Got it, not a big deal. Now for the recording video there are a couple options that would be nice to control - like auto shake and auto night mode. Here's what the manual says, &#34;The camera start to record automatic when it is open up, press OK key to stop recording which pressed again to restart recording, press up and down key in recording model to save electricity Press up and down key in recording model for mode switch in day and night, night scene is open fill-in light.&#34; Yeah. That's typed verbatim. So, the up and down key &#34;save electricity&#34; and &#34;mode switch in day and night&#34; in &#34;recording model&#34;. Despite trying about a dozen things, all I can get the up and down keys to do are zoom in and out the camera. That was starting to get kind of frustrating because the fill lights were staying on and there was no way to turn them off or convince the camera to go out of night mode. Finally I resorted to a system reset which quite helpfully switched all the menus to Chinese and (amazingly) turned off the the night mode and associated fill light. Yay. There is also a G sensor (maybe that's the anti-shake?) that ambiguously offers me 2G, 4G, 8G, and OFF. I tried 2G and OFF in the hopes that it would reduce the number of times I thought, &#34;Gee, I have no idea how this option is supposed to work&#34; but alas, my &#34;Gee&#34; count continued to rise. Motion detection? Okay.....well, that's nice, but since it's in a car won't there almost always be motion? I was happy though to find out that &#34;You can press reset and starting up the product when a crash happened because disoperation, it will get right.&#34; Thank goodness! I hate it when I crash my car and it disoperates, but with a push of a button it will get right!"

Really nice, full sound.  Strong bluetooth range.<br />Haven't tested the water-proof abilities and probably won't.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The NFC pairing seems non-existent.  The manual tells me to put the phone on an NFC label that simply is not there.  Why do I care?  Well, there is a voice that tells you when you connect/disconnect.  Part of me likes knowing but the problem is that when I'm in another part of my house and coming in and out of range there is an odd male voice upstairs scaring my kids.  Well. maybe just freaking them out a little.  I bought this, in part, because the NFC should let me connect when I'm in the room and disconnect when I walk out.  Instead, I can't do that.<br /><br />So while I really like the sound and size I'm debating if I will return this due to a non-existent feature."

B00YO3UYXW,Jensen MCR-100 Cassette Player/Recorder 1 Touch Recording with Headphone Jack & Aux Line-in,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I recently purchased the Jensen Portable Cassette Player/Recorder to replace my 40-year old Panasonic counterpart, which had been my trusted mainstay until it malfunctioned during an important Association Board Meeting.  From that moment forward, I realized that I needed a dependable recorder and began searching several local consumer outlet stores for this product.  After a couple of weeks without having any success at locating such an antiquated device, I turned to Amazon.com.  To my amazement, this iconic store offered an assortment of cassette player/recorders at affordable prices.  Within five days after ordering a portable recorder, I obtained what I thought was a compatible replacement for my old Panasonic.  However, to my dismay, I found issues with the replacement recorder's volume control and built-in microphone and had to return the item.  When I resumed my search for a dependable cassette player/recorder that functioned as advertised, I was fortunate to find the Jensen product offered by Todays Concept.  This portable cassette player/recorder is worth every penny I spent.  It is compact, lightweight and easy to operate.  The record/play/rewind/fast fwd/stop/eject and pause buttons do not stick when pressed, which is a plus for baby boomers like me who suffer with arthritic stiff fingers.  Although the recorder's built-in condenser microphone functions adequately, for acute clarity of sound I recommend using the external microphone with stand that is included with the recorder.  I assure you, this small microphone is powerful enough to record your inner thoughts, if you are so inclined to articulate them.  I rate this product as 4 and one half stars."

I bought it to run and portable oxygen concentrator while on the road since the 12v aux feed from my Prius does not provide the amps needed.  It has worked fine on a couple of road trips.  Just today I put a high quality volt meter on the ac output and was astonished to find that it only put out 90v.  Under load or no load.  With this low voltage there is a potential to damage any electronics that expects the ac voltage to be in the range of 105v - 125v.  This is why I gave it only one star.

Not very loud, however, as such things go.  At max, a moderate listening level.<br /><br />Fit/Build profile:  Has rubber feet for vertical positioning, yet plays well horizontally - just be aware that also covers the funky, oddball, what-on-earth Volume, Track AND Power all on a single hybrid slide dial & push button thing that did indeed befuddle me for a few minutes.  All the instructions say is \\""Turn It On\\"".  Great.  It wasn't until I was fooling with that tiny little thing and happen to press against it that I realized you are supposed to long press it in (like a good three seconds at least) to turn it on/off.  And its a pretty tiny slot, not to mention I can see beefy fingers (like one brothers) having a frustrating grapple with it.  This is my main hit.<br /><br />Bluetooth Signal Reception Strength:  On par, through major obstructions, such as walls.<br /><br />Battery Life: It does not disclose an official battery life, even in the instructions.  However, it disclose the use of a 1050mAh battery, so I would estimate 6-8 hours continual play, depending on volume.  This is average for this size of speaker, so neither good nor bad.<br /><br />Additional Observations:  Upper ring around that huge Play/Pause/Answer button (makes that tiny gnome-designed thing on the bottom even smaller in comparison) is a soft, blinking blue when in use.  Turns red while charging, and the red does turn off when full.  Does show the battery life meter on my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1).  Nice mesh carrying case.<br /><br />Summary:<br />So it had the audio goods, and I like the overall form factor of it.  Just a) not a crunking volume, and b) surely a more standard method of powering, volume, and track selection could have been used...<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.efully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations."

I don't listen at max volume and got around 3-4 hours off a charge.<br />  The charging speed depends on the charger you use (it has nothing to do with the cable).  It charges in an hour or 2 with my nice 2 amp charger and takes much longer plugged into a laptop or standard phone charger.  This is standard for any device being charged by USB so don't blame the speaker if it takes forever to charge.<br />  The sound quality is decent.  Not a lot of bass but it's much better than the speakers that come on your cellphone and a lot louder as well.<br />  The suction cup on mine was awesome.  I stuck it to my windshield in the south Georgia heat for more than 2 weeks and it didn't fall off. (my car radio doesn't have bluetooth and I was listening to Pandora on a road trip)<br />  The volume level changes in small increments.  I have had other bluetooth audio devices that increment in large steps so you go from not quite loud enough to way too loud.  This one has small steps so it's easy to find the right audio level.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />  Definitely not &#34;Waterproof&#34; more like &#34;Water Resistant.&#34;  I purchased this for music while Kayaking.  It got splashed a little and didn't seem adversely affected, but it got dunked and started acting weird.  It kept powering on and off again.  The buttons are actually part of a rubber ring that goes all the way around the speaker.  I pulled the ring off and let it air dry and it works good as new.  It's worth the then bucks I paid but they should really change the description.<br />  The volume and track change buttons are the same buttons.  Long press for volume, short press to change tracks.  This can get annoying if you forget and tap the button trying to bump the volume up a bit (as happened to me frequently)"

My daughter (7 yr old) has received my husband's old iPod Touch 4 and to make it special for her we wanted a case for it that would match her style. When we saw that this item came with four cases and two stylus we were sold! My daughter has so much fun picking out which case to switch to and they are easy for her to take off and put on but they stay on great! They fit perfectly and the price could not be beat.

B00J5Q9OOI,Beats by Dr. Dre Studio 2.0 Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with RemoteTalk Cable (Matte Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"Fantastic device. I use this everyday. They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.<br /><br />----Pros---<br />-Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices<br />-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym<br />-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.<br />-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.<br /><br />---Cons---<br />-Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop<br />-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.<br />-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty. I bought a 3 year one, just in case my sweating at the gym eventually kills it."

I thought this was the whole visor which may have been my fault so when I just received a small metal piece with 2 screws i was shocked. A small metal piece for $25??? Anyway it wasn't what I needed so I requested to be able to return it. The email I received back was unbelievable. Very harsh. See below...<br /><br />don't understand. You say in your statement that you expected what was in the picture. There were 2 pictures of Broken visors. Are saying that is what you expected? Item is EXACTLY as described. The very first thing the Description and Listing states is that it is for a &#34;TOYOTA CAMRY SUN VISOR REPAIR KIT&#34;.  Listing and product description states FOURTEEN (14) TIMES that it is for REPAIR and is a REPAIR KIT.  Please explain where the &#34;Description Was Not Accurate&#34; as you have claimed. It certainly appears that you did not read the listing whatsoever which does not constitute a full refund.  Even so Buyer may return the repair kit but the following must be done before any refund will be issued.<br /><br />Very very unprofessional. I will not purchase from them again.

Loud enough to fill a room with sound with just two speakers connected.  If some music appear low in sound, it is most likely how it was recorded. i.e. low volume or low bit rate.  Some mp3's are better quality than others depending on copy.  Equalizing automatic sound levels throughout various albums would ensure same levels.  Non of this has to do with AMP quality or output but more with music being used and how it was ripped.  LOVE THE LITTLE AMP.  One thing that would be nice is a headphone jack which is not available.

How mobile it is, and how loud it is. It's loud enough for my friends and I to just tune to some music while playing games, or whatever.<br />The thing is, distance, since this is my first blue tooth device I've had I don't know if this is normal, but if I walk out of  the room, it stops, and cracks up, or when I block it with my body from my phone.<br />Honestly, it's the price, I'd rather by 5 of these then one upper end speaker. Quality is great and base is heavy.<br />Love every bit of it."

I've dropped it a couple times by mistake and the case has held up fine. No damage at all. I also appreciate that you can remove your phone from the case without tools and it does take some force to unsnap the front as it should. With some other cases, the front cover is too easily removed and sometimes would fall off when the phone was dropped. This case doesn't have that problem.

B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"I bought the S-8 model for this product and I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound - especially the bass performance - for such a small set of speakers. I use it as a drone sound (taanpura) for my Indian classical vocal practice with an apple store app and it feels great! The sound absolutely fills up a small room easily...The only two possible improvements I wish for are 1) an ability to connect to another device by automatically disconnecting the previously connected one (this needs to be done manually for now) and 2) perhaps an ability to connect to two or three such speakers from a single device so that different tracks could be played on different speakers! Those two will make this a dream-come-true for me!<br /><br />I love the fact that it can be also used in the car essentially as a hands free system to receive calls (and I haven't tried but could be perhaps used with Siri/Google to make calls by talking into it) !<br /><br />The buying experience was also smooth & pleasant. It came in an absolutely beautiful box with a modern design - one wonders how many things Steve Jobs passion for good design has inspired!  BTW, I Love the rubberized top & bottom, too!"

I have a different Dash Cam that folds up the screen. This one does not fold, so at night, the screen lights everything up.. when you park your car at night and forget to unplug or turn off, it lights up the inside of the car and can be seen for blocks telling all thieves to come and get it !!  Also.. The screen that lights everything up at night gets dark spots. More and more of them.. When the car gets hot from being parked, the screen is worthless !!  At least at night it cools off and gets bright for all the thieves..  It is not that where I live there are lots of them, but when you go downtown or other places and park your car, why send it up the flag pole that you have a electronic device in your car !!  Heck.. Thieves would not know at a glance I only paid 20 bucks for this thing !! Heck the window they break to get it cost more !!!  Also.. The Suction device grabs the glass well, but the slider part that hooks to the actual Dash cam slides off around hard turns and the Dash Cam lands in your lap !!  I guess you could somehow reverse it so it lands in your girlfriends lap and you could then have an excuse for being grabby..  Not sure.. But worth a try..."

It is made with high quality materials. I love the fact the the radio is light weight and has a great grip. It is not heavy like Motorols that i used in past. My uncle owns a parking lot so it was always a great problem for them to communicate with employees. Since they got this BaoFeng radio communication has become so much better.Below are few facts and things that i like about these Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.<br /><br />-  When you turn the device on, a voice says &#34;Power On&#34; and then speaks the channel number. As you change channels, it speaks the channel you just selected. That is very useful and makes things much easy,<br />-  Very durable, light weight and comfortable to hold.<br />-  Power-saving features to extend battery life.<br />-  Features Include CTCSS/DCS function, Scanning function, Emergency alarm, VOX, TOT and Monitor Functions.<br />-  They are also programmable through PC.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping:  The radios came very nicely packaged in the box which contain: Two radios, Two antenna, Two Li-ion battery pack, Two charger, Two  belt clips, Two slings and User's manual. The shipping was also very fast, i got the BaoFeng radio in two days after placing the order. The price is very reasonable for such a great quality. Luckily i bought them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am glad that i did because these BaoFeng radios are very well build, light weight and operationally, they perform quite well. I definitely recommend this Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.

B00XAJ384S,SD 1 - Studio Dome 1 - Portable Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker with Voice Prompt,Mobile_Electronics,2,Got my speaker yesterday and was very impressed with the speaker at first. It's sturdy and appears to be well constructed. I took it to work with me and it played fine. Everyone was impressed. I tried to use it last night and again this morning with no luck. It just sits as if maybe it's frozen or something. When I turn the power button off the light stays green. At this time the only thing I can use this for is a paper weight or desk ornament. I have a GEARHEAD Bluetooth speaker that I had been using before deciding to buy this one. It's not as heavy but plays just as loud and works every time. I'll contact the manufacturer to see if it is a software problem that can be remedied or something. I desperately want this to work but if not then I'm fine with getting my money back purchasing a second GEARHEAD.

B00WHYWGWC,ZhiZhu&#174;Digital Wireless Stereo Foldable Headphone MP3 Player SD/TF Music FM Radio Battery Chargable Headset,Mobile_Electronics,5,"My 12 year old son loves them. They don't come with a microSD card but the generic one I got from Wal-Mart is working perfectly. Navigating between the radio and the player is easy and well explained in the directions. The volume is the best (or worst if you have a kid who loves to blast their drums out) part. when you turn the radio up to max volume, you can hear it fine even from your lap. I love that the radio finds all the presets for you as your move from one area to the next. It found all the available stations in MI, then in CO when we went and then in AZ so my son could enjoy the radio even before we were able to load up his microSD with songs.<br /><br />Just make sure your young ones protect their ears when listening to the radio and MP3 player because the volume gets pretty loud. As headphones they aren't as loud, at least I never heard them when he was using them to play on the android tablet or his handheld thingamajig...Sega I think it is?<br /><br />I love that it functions well as ear phones and as an mp3 player and as a radio. Usually multipurpose devices sacrifice quality for the convenience of an all in one but that is not the case here. Not to mention that it's foldable and the cord detaches so the cord itself can essentially double to attach the earphones to say your car's speaker so that what's on the SD card can be heard by everyone. VERY COOL!"

I'm disappointed in this product because the results I receive are broken into about 2 min increments. For example I pass a truck on the highway. The first frame shows me behind it as the video ends. I start the next recording in sequence and I'm next to the cab of the vehicle. There is a time lapse of about 30-60 seconds. If something would happen during this time, it would not be collected on video. I find myself not having faith in the recordings since Im missing time. If im using it wrong please let me know and I'll be glad to change my rating."

In fact, I'm sure this is a fake Beats Pill.  The sound is not as loud or clear as the real one.  After 3 hours of charging it still wasn't fully charged.  The charging cord and auxiliary cord are of very poor quality and do not have the beats logo.  The weight is lighter than the real Beats.

I'm still giving it three stars though because there's a really good chance it was my fault.

While the steelie is great for holding your phone in the car it does prevent any phone with stylus &#34;draw on screen&#34; features from working. So if you have a phone with the draw on feature and want to continge to be able to use the feature, you need to buy an easily removed hard case to stick the steelie magnet to.

B00OMSIQ8E,E-PRANCE New Arrival B47fs Super Hd 1296p,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I ordered this E-Prance Dash cam back in May to replace my crappy old standard definition with no useful features. On paper this one looked great and had all the features I wanted. Super wide angle lens, GPS tracking, Speed tracking, super high definition, etc. Overall I've been very pleased with it but it has one major flaw that is simply irredeemable and prevents a 5 star rating. That flaw is it's stupid patented GPS suction-cup mount. At first I was willing to overlook this minor annoyance but after a few months it's proved to be a royal pain in the butt. What ends up happening is over time it gets loose, this is especially true if you move the dash cam from one vehicle to another a few times or simply adjust the angle (not a lot, I've only moved it about 6 times).  What this means is that when you go over a few bumps in the road or around a corner to fast the entire camera unit moves. That perfect camera angle you spend 10 minutes setting up is lost. This wouldn't be a big deal if it used a standard suction cup mount where you can adjust the tightness of the swivel and the up and down motion. Not the case with their suction cup mount, there is no adjustment. You have literally no way to lock the camera into position. Lets say I wanted to for whatever reason point the camera out my windshield facing the sky, I can't do that because the mount is so loose and it will quickly fall into a lower position facing my dashboard.<br />I'd originally overlooked what now seems like an obvious feature to have in such a pricey dash camera... I'm super pleased with everything else this camera does and has to offer but.... I don't know, I guess I'll just continue taking great HD video of my dashboard and a few feet in front of where I'm driving."
B01416742A,"Powerful Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with High Quality Hands-free Speakerphone, Rechargable Battery, Connects to Any Device Though Bluetooth/aux",Mobile_Electronics,1,"I want to first start out by saying that I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review of the product.  With that said, even at a discount, this speaker is not worth it, allow me to tell you why.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 1 Star<br />Since Sound Quality is obviously the most important part of a bluetooth speaker, I figured I'd start my review by talking about how awful the sound quality is on this speaker.  You can only really turn the volume up halfway before the speaker starts distorting.  Not only that, but if the speaker is at full volume, the vocals are almost not audible because of so much distortion.  Just based off of the Sound Quality portion of my review, I would say definitely do not purchase this speaker.  It was not the discounted price, and it definitely is not worth the full price.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY - 3 Stars<br />The Build Quality was middle of the road.  Nothing to immediately complain about, nothing to write home about either.  The Design itself is edgy and modern which is nice.  The usb and 3.5m jacks feel solid enough.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY - 3 Stars<br />The Bluetooth connectivity is very mediocre.  It started disconnecting at 25 feet when I walked just outside of my house.  It's good if you keep it near by.<br /><br />OVERALL - 1 Star<br />This bluetooth speaker is not worth it's $40 price tag.  It's also not worth the discounted price I got it for.  And it's all because of how poor the actual sound quality is.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this speaker."

As we still have a regular tape deck in the house, I took the same noisy horrible tape that made me cringe on the ION device, and it played just fine on the normal tape deck.  My solution:  haul the tape deck upstairs and put this Ion set in the electronics recycle bin.  It fell far short of expectations.  Decent software doesn't make up for a lousy audio system.<br /><br />I hate to write bad reviews, but you should be warned this is not going to render results you enjoy."

Realizing that you really don't get too much for the cheap price, this radio was not even worth the $99. It seemed like a nicely built piece of equipment, but the performance of the receiver was really bad.  It measured very sensitive on the bench, but mobile operation was impossible.  Most signals would break up with some sort of low frequency &#34;motorboating&#34;.  Any time there was any mobile flutter on the signal, the audio would break up badly.  I tried to use it as a fixed station, but there were spurious blips and sputter that were traced to strong signals 16 Mhz away..  It was always breaking squelch and noisy. The microphone audio on transmit was horrible.  I went to return the radio, but found I had missed the deadline by 5 days, so now I have a $99 item for the trash barrel."

B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"This speaker is really inexpensive and before I received it, I had my doubts about how good it would work and I was totally wrong! This speaker even works with my 4 year old smartphone, it worked with my Samsung Galaxy S4 and connects with out laptops and Ipad Mini super easily.  I am now also linking a Iphone 6 and it is so simple from any device.<br /><br />The volume that comes out of this little speaker box is tremendous and I don't say the word tremendous very often but that is exactly what it is! We took this on vacation with us and it didn't take up a whole lot of space, it was the perfect way to listen to music and connect with our different devices.  Great for listening to music on the beach on vacation.<br /><br />The rechargeable battery gives about 10 hours of playtime which I think is decent and the USB charger makes it really convenient!<br /><br />I use Skype a lot and the speaker is perfect for skype calls which means my whole family can talk to my relatives in the UK without having to sit around a computer.<br /><br />My favorite element of this speaker is the ease of use, it only has a few buttons making it super simple to use!<br /><br />I would recommend this product as a value for the price! I did receive a slight discount for honest feedback.  If you are in the market this product could work well for you!"

That's the only good thing I can say about it.  This is a very cheap MP3 player...in every way.  It's programming functions make no sense...you have to fight with it to get it to do what you want it to do.  I am quite tech savvy and it frustrates the heck out of me.  I actually bought it as a gift for my dad.  I thought he might like an MP3 player, but I didn't want to get an expensive one because I wasn't sure how much he would actually use it.  Fortunately I opened this one up to load some stuff for him and try it out a bit, but I'm not even sure I'm going to give it to him.  I'm 100% sure he will use it once and never pick it up again.  I would rate this thing as nothing more than a glorified flash drive.  If you want a MP3 player, do yourself a favor, pay 2-3x more and get a halfway decent one.  Seriously."
B00UG5GUWG,Bem HL2022 Bluetooth Mobile Speaker for Smartphones (Certified Refurbished),Mobile_Electronics,3,"This speaker can get pretty loud despite its small size and connects to Bluetooth quickly.<br />The Play/Pause button is not very sensitive and when pressed, there is sort of a significant lag between when it is pressed and when it actually pauses. The Volume Up/Down works well with no lag in between.<br />The battery life doesn't last as long as advertised (6 hours), it seems like it needs to be charged after 4 hours.<br />There should be a light or some other type of indicator to notify if this device is on/off. It would be too easy to leave these speakers on and coming back to it later without any batteries left in it"

B007WO5LF6,EC TECHNOLOGY? New design Backup External Battery Pack and Charger (Power Bank) with flashlight,Mobile_Electronics,2,"I purchased this with the idea that I could carry it in my purse for emergency power when my cell is out.  I don't carry a big purse, so the size works.  However, there is not much power available for recharging.  Basically, it's enough to make a few, short phone calls, but that's it.  So it's more emergency, emergency than I really wanted, not even 1/8th recharge.  The other problem is that the button to turn on the flashlight is raised with no cover, and while in my purse while knocking around with other things, it turns on too easily and power is lost with the flashlight on.  I'm glad it was relatively inexpensive because it's not a huge loss, but I would not have bought it if I had known about these things."

B00PGMLH68,"DeLorme BU-353S4 USB GPS Receiver with Street Atlas USA 2015 PLUS, L1, 1575.42 MHz Frequency, SiRF STAR IV GSD4e, 48 Channels, 1.023 MHz Chip Rate",Mobile_Electronics,1,"If you’re after the short, down and dirty version, here it is…<br />This program is a complete waste of time and energy.<br /><br />Now, for the actual review.<br /><br />If you’re after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.

Why?  No one knows.<br /><br />Then you will have to deal with the so called manual that came with the camera.  If you can figure out some of these phrases, let me know because I have given up on this worthless three page manual:<br /><br />“select 2/5/15 minute to decide how many time will be storage pre one section.”…and<br />“DC5V input, please use the attached care charger.

B00ZFE4SBS,"Aweek® Universal Waterproof 12V 4 Vehicle Parking Sensors Buzzer Car Reverse Backup Rear Radar Kit Alarm Indicator Probe, Black",Mobile_Electronics,4,I wanted to install this unit myself  to see just how easy it is to install.. It is easy with good steps even for the novice but admittedly time consuming so if your not willing to take at least half a day on your project then your best shot is professional installation.. The four star doesn't reflect on the product but rather the detail you have to do in order to hide the wiring.. Doing it yourself will end up as a professional install if you take your time. I enjoyed every moment of it and received much applause of the finished product. Works as stated.. an enjoyable addition to our backup cam which now we can not only see but also hear thus saving strained eyes whenever we're backing up or parallel parking. A really good and needed security system. sample provided at discount for inspection purposes and an unbiased review.

B00QERR5CY,iXCC Multi pack Lightning cable,Mobile_Electronics,2,"Just got them today and they work perfectly for charging, it arrived 2 days earlier than had originally been estimated so that was a pleasant surprise. Will update when this or the OE charging cable fails with comparisons. UPDATE 11/5/16: These cable have actually been failing more frequently on average than OE Lightning cables with less use even. I have the original lighting cable that came with my 6 in my work truck and it takes a beating, from being bent up sitting in the cup holder when I use my GPS and when I unplug it letting it hit the floor and drag all over the dirt, it still works perfectly. On the other hand, these iXCC cables by my night stand, only charging my phone for short periods before I go to bed, lasts on average about a month and a half or two months. Weird considering it doesn't get beat up or dragged around and isn't being constantly used like the other one. Definitely still a good price but I can actually justify buying the exorbitantly overpriced apple replacements with longevity in mind."

I have no problems reviewing recordings and reading lic. plate numbers or other fine details. Works perfectly since I bought it in February, (its now August), even after leaving it mounted on the window all summer. The one minor issue I had just recently, is that the suction cup itself broke off the mount. Looks like the black plastic ring in the suction cup failed somehow and detached from the rest of mount, the camera itself is fine. Anyway I contacted E-Prance, they were very responsive, and will be sending me a new replacement mount.<br /><br />I had one issue, I brought it into the house, plugged it into my laptop, it powered up, but said there was a error reading the memory card (Samsung) so I tried another card, but same results, I emailed E-Prance, and got a reply the next day, but that morning I plugged it into the car, and noticed it worked fine. Again trying it on the laptop it didn't work, and I realized that I do occansionally have problems with my laptop not having enough power in the USB ports for newer devices, like my 10&#34; tablet. Works like a champ in the car, and plugged into the A/C usb for power, so if you have an older laptop be aware of that."

Of course, I saw that in the picture before buying so I knew what I was getting. The second complaint is there is no way to adjust volume when in FM mode. It may use whatever volume that was set in mp3 mode but I haven't played with it enough to confirm that. Even if it does, who wants to switch modes every time the volume needs adjusted?"

The item arrived quite quickly which was great however this is the only positive thing i can really say about this. I gave the MP3 player plenty of charge so it would last for around 6hours of constant use. I took the mp3 to work the next day and the device only worked for around two hours as the battery life had depleted. I immediately put this item on charge after use as i thought it might not have charged correctly, however after trying it the next day i powered up the device and straight away it turned itself off after a few moments. I have also noticed that the centre button is not working at all. Really disappointed with this item and i would highly recommend to anyone considering this as a purchase to look elsewhere and spend a little bit more cash or find another device as this item is really rubbish and really not worth wasting 20 dollars and now i have an item that no doesn't work."

I know how expensive it can get to have it added as a feature in your car if you are to go to a service center. Now my wish is granted, I have this camera in our car with decent price. If you are not inclined with wirings and stuff in the car it will be hard for you to install this. We installed it to where when you put the car in reverse, the monitor will turn on and this will give the view. My husband really likes this! It gives a good view at the back and keeps everyone safe when backing up. It works well at night too. If only I knew that putting a rear camera isn't that costly I would have done it long time ago. We haven't tested it under rainy condition since it hasn't been raining in California lately. But I will definitely give you an update after we tried that. I am so happy to be able to purchase this for a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."

It was reasonably priced for giving me peace of mind that it wouldn't get damaged or have anyone smell my dry herb resin in my Pax2 (and I use mine a lot). I'm not saying it can trick a trained dog, but honestly if it got past the TSA in NY and Orlando International airport without being noticed on the X-ray or smelt, and survived how rugged they treat your checked luggage (literally throwing it on and off the plane) then I bet this can protect/hide it from anything. Highly recommended, especially for travel."

The case stops all odor and smells from escaping, it's waterproof as I tested this feature personally.  Very durable, good fit.  The latch works well, and seals the top O-ring very tight.  Everyone who sees the case loves it, very discrete and hardly adds any bulk to the pax itself.  I was worried the case may scratch the pax's finish, but after a month of use I don't see any wear or tear.  Very solid case, I would buy again or recommend to anyone with a Pax."

NFC, Bluetooth, aux, this speaker makes every possible connection possible. I had some family members help me evaluate this product, and some of the opinions I got were detailed sound, BOOMING BASS (thought of this one myself), and great build. The bass really is amazing, though, with the sound up high you can really feel the thud in the music when the low note hits. My sister even said she was thinking about buying one herself! On top of the device are play / pause, Volume Up and Volume Down buttons.<br /><br />Now the problem, which was pretty small, so I couldn't decide what to say here. The speaker automatically connects to the last paired device when turned on, and if you turn off the Bluetooth on a connected device, you have to restart the speaker to get the device back into pairing mode. I also compared this small issue with a Skullcandy Soundmine, which had the same problem. This is a small problem compared to the many connection methods, great design, and great sound quality.<br /><br />Adding this as an afterthought, the speaker is smaller than expected, but still just as loud."

What I like is the clean installation.  What could use some improvement is the video quality.  Video with sufficient lighting is great, but low light conditions create hard to see images.  The other issue is that the video sometimes gets recorded choppy (like watching a movie reel that is off the wheel).  Not sure what is causing it, but it happens.  All-in-all, it serves the purpose of having documentation of things happening in front and behind my vehicle.  If you want clear video in any light conditions, you must spend the big bucks."

I was just looking for a camera to make sure I don't hit a shopping cart, a kid, another persons car or a person in a bike cus we all know they never lookout for themselves. Overall the camera serves it's purpose which is what I was looking for, a rear-view camera at an affordable price. I wasn't expecting full H-D when I ordered this and don't need it for something that I may spend a total of 40 seconds a day looking at ,if that. The quality of the camera is good during the day and at night it's pretty good too, I have LED lights for my reverse lights so that does help. I also liked that it had a little grid so I know where I'm going. The camera came with a drill bit to drill the perfect size hole in my car which I really appreciated, it also came with the needed power cable and video cable. For me it was really easy to install since I have installed stereos and monitor in my cars in the past and also have installed audio and video in my home so it took less then 30 minutes and that's only because I'm the type of person that likes to have a nice professional looking install and don't like having wires all over the place. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review but would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a camera to serve it's purpose."
B00SE92TKS,Mini VCI 16 PIN OBD2 Diagnostic Cable for TOYOTA TIS Techstream Cable V9.30.002,Mobile_Electronics,4,"Item came in decent time (3 weeks) from across the Pacific. Works, but not with the software it came with. I downloaded v9.30.002 and it worked great. The disc that came has techstream v10.00 and the FTDI drivers which installed fine, but the TIS Key generator does not work which is required for this version. Maybe my system is at fault, however I doubt it. Especially since v9.30.002 worked fine."

B00L7C22WE,"REXING F9US Version 2.7"" LCD FHD 1080p 170 Degree Wide Angle Car Dashboard Camera Recorder Dash Cam with G-Sensor, WDR, Motion Detection",Mobile_Electronics,1,"This has the potential to be a great inexpensive dashcam, but two flaws are ruining it for me:<br />1. Despite what the product pictures show, the camera has a BRIGHT silver lens barrel, not the more subtle black one show in the pics. This would be a minor cosmetic issue, except for the fact that the silver barrel makes this SUPER OBVIOUS if you leave it mounted to your windshield when your car is parked. It's like the damn thing was designed to be enticing to thieves. I contacted Amazon about this and they sent me a second one, which (despite the pics on the site and the product box) also sports the bright silver color. Annoying, but fixable with a Sharpie and some time.<br />2. The dashcam broke within a couple weeks of installing it. It works for about 3 minutes before powering off completely, and refuses to power up again until the power cord is completely disconnected and re-inserted (hardly safe while driving). I've heard good things from trusted sources about this camera so I'm hoping this is just a fluke and hopefully the soon-to-be-received replacement will be awesome, but this early and sudden failure (coupled with the issue noted above) doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Wanted to provide an update. About ~15 months after purchasing the original and then getting the replacement because the 1st one was DOA, the second camera is broken. It powers on and I can &#34;use&#34; it as you'd expect, but it no longer records reliably to memory cards (I've tried with different known-good cards formatted in-camera). Super frustrating to find out that it stopped recording files to the card months ago, despite all the icons on the LCD display indicating everything is working fine. Naturally it is just outside the manufacturers warranty now, so I've got an $89 paperweight. I strongly encourage you to skip this camera and buy something else - this one is junk. :-("

It is also partly my fault that I didn't do a little more research before purchasing the product.<br /><br />Pros<br />-The bluetooth connection is awesome. Gives you the ability to listen to pandora and any other music app through your phone. When I use the mic to talk on the phone through the car, people are amazed at the quality of my voice. Im glad that this unit is so clear.<br />-You can play DVD's.....<br /><br />That's as far as I can go with the standouts.<br /><br />The issue i have for this is that, I cant really imagine many people using the DVD feature anymore, considering DVD or any kind of CD device is outdated technology, especially if you have a smart phone that you are connecting to this device. I bought this unit thinking I might be able to play youtube, and other video files on the screen. ONCE AGAIN PLAYING VIDEO/MEDIA FILES FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE CANNOT BE DONE WITH THIS UNIT! I have to capslock that statement in case people are thinking that this 2015 model unit would have that feature.<br /><br />In my defense I searched the pioneer's main website prior to purchasing to get some more details about this product. It had a little ad that showed the phone app that you can download to use with pioneer headunits. I mistakenly took that ad as a feature for this specific unit. That app does not work for this unit, unless someone can show me otherwise.<br /><br />Hope this helps a few of you guys."

I loved it so much I bought one for myself!

I literally am the worst techy person (I don't have any music on my phone because I don't know how to get it on there!) and even I got the bluetooth to work.  I can listen to &#34;The Moth&#34; from my iphone or watch a movie on my laptop and actually hear what is going on.  I have other speakers that I bought through Amazon as well and I loved those.  But, what I like specifically about this is that it is bluetooth and it doesn't have to be plugged in. And the other speakers I can't use with my ipad or iphone.

Some lasted 3 days: none served me for more than a month before breaking.  And most cost at least twice as much as this gold all-metal BT speaker that looks like the interchangeable lens for an SLR camera.<br /><br />In short, this is the only non-brand, inexpensive BT speaker that I could recommend and that I might give as a gift.  The audio quality is loud enough and decent for a speaker of this size, and the speaker has proven durable, lasting me for an entire year.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few caveats: You should not expect to hear much bass (or, for that matter, anything close to full-frequency sound).  Also, any reference to an FM radio is unlikely to have any relevance in the West, where all you're likely to receive is static.  Finally, my &#34;pre-2014&#34; version of this speaker charges with a &#34;mini SD&#34; connector (commonly used to transfer images from a digital camera to computer) instead of the more common &#34;micro SD&#34; connector."
B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"Whenever I review an electronic, especially one dealing with audio output, people always wants to compare a high end unit to a value brand, when, in fact, its apples to oranges.I don't use my Infinity One portable speaker for the same sound output, situations, or locations as I do my JBL Charge 2. While part of it has to do with one being valued at almost triple the other- the majority of my reasoning is in the strengths one device has over the other. And yes, even in a much lower end device you are bound to find applications more suited to a $100 speaker than a $300 one. While one may deliver crisp expansive audio, the other may have a significantly longer battery standby life, for example.<br /><br />Primarily, for us, this bluetooth speaker has an appeal in the range of features it boasted at such an expendable price point. No one wants to hear their product is 'expendable,' but our brand loyalty to Sentey comes mostly from their execution of easy to use, functional, gaming products under a $50 price point. The convenience of Bluetooth devices lie in the portability of the product, and the vary nature of being portable puts a tech device in harms way from circumstances such as theft, water damage, and improper use (especially if your devices are used in communal circumstances.) While I would love to take my Infinity One to work at the marina and in the golf cart, my paycheck can't afford any mishaps around water or sticky hands from teenage skateboarders. In that case, I desire portable audio that is quick to setup, long lasting in life, and durable in design- with a price point under $50- so here we are testing the Sentey Bluetooth 4.0:<br /><br />Yays:<br /><br />*We always start with packaging- This speaker looks like it could have just come off Best Buy's shelf- It was packaged in a sturdy box inside an outer packaging sleeve. Not only did the box seem like it could withstand shipping and even continual storage, it was colorful and informative, something you don't often see in a value tech brand.<br /><br />*The design is very attractive- many 'bargain' bluetooth speakers come in bright gaudy colors that look and feel cheap- or targeted towards tweens. The slick black facing and 360 speaker design is very modern and style friendly for any geographic or setting. I love how the buttons on the top are inlaid under the rubber coated material so the speaker's operation is quite intuitive and seamless. While this speaker is not waterproof in a sense it could fall into water, the buttons on the top are all beneath the facing, so one could handle it with damp or wet hands without worry (this would be great in a kitchen when working on a recipe.)<br /><br />*This speaker includes a complimentary carry case, which you will want to use because the rubberized top and bottom coating seems to scuff easily. The case fits a little snug and has a drawstring close.<br /><br />*A big plus for me was the ability to play while plugged in- and the device even seemed to maintain or gain a charge while playing and charging. This mainly means I can use it as a stationary speaker in my office for an entire day without having to fuss with it.<br /><br />*Bluetooth pairing was quick, my devices located it on the first scan and there was no searching or fancy button configurations- simply turn it on and put your streaming device in Bluetooth discovery mode.<br /><br />*The product advertises up to 33 feet of connection thanks to Bluetooth 4.0 technology. This is a direct line of path claim- with minor obstructions such as furniture and a dresser, we maintained about a 15 foot connectivity. I COULD keep connectivity through the wall but this was a pretty direct proximity, best estimated at 8 to no more than 10 feet. When outside with no obstructions we successfully measured 30 feet of crisp, uninterrupted transmission.<br /><br />*I like that there is a direct on/off switch so there is never confusion about whether the speaker is on or off- this helps save battery life.<br /><br />*Speaking of battery life- This DOES have exceptional battery life for the value and clarity. On a full charge of Bluetooth wireless radio app streaming we've clocked 7 hours and 50 minutes play time.<br /><br />*The sound is stereo with 2 5 watt drivers for 10 watts total at about 125-250hz audio output. The bass on this speaker is fairly impressive for the price and size but not the same caliber as high output speakers you'd find over $200. In general, this speaker does beautifully with layered audio and instrumental heavy tracks- vocals can sound a little tinny at times (illustrated on the devices bluetooth calling feature) but in general what this device lacks in precision clarity (and don't get me wrong, it's great audio for the price range) it makes up in volume. Oh so very much volume. I can fill an entire veranda or pool deck with the output from this single portable speaker.<br /><br />Mehs:<br /><br />*While it seemed to turn 'on' out of the box, it would not pair- This is because it had no prior or residual charge. In general it's a pet peeve of mine when electronics don't include batteries, or a partial charge. No one wants to open a gift and have to wait hours to play with it.<br /><br />*Charge time from empty to full was long for a device of this size and output- it took nearly 3 hours (2 hours 45 minutes) to charge out of the box.<br /><br />*The upper and bottom material is a rubberized grip that is soft and slick but seems to scuff very easy.<br /><br />*The included cables aren't the highest quality or length. If you are an audiophile you likely have better quality cabled laying around- the charging cable, in particular fit a little snug for my liking. We use our own cables for aux and charging.<br /><br />*This claims to deliver big sound without the bulk- I feel it is one of the more bulky bluetooth speakers I own, especially for amp and bass output. Bulky can be a good thing, especially when you plan on using the speaker outdoors ad in social stations often. Bulky, in this case, also means it has weight in the hand and feels like it is built well- however, it certainly is not a dainty speaker.<br /><br />*It's hard to determine when you are done charging the speaker, and there's no real way to know how many hours or what percentage of battery life you have left. A visual queue or different colored light/patterns would be nice.<br /><br />In summary, this product performs at a believable range for it's list price of $69, and we've found it a great deal for the current asking price of $34 with prime. I like that this speaker has more of a presence than some of other other 'micro and portable bluetooth audio options and feel confident enough in the product that I would gift one to any casual to moderate music lover. I received a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done.for the value and clarity.

B00QV5HEAM,"XTRONS® Twin 2X 9"" Car Headrest Mount Slim Thin Monitor Portable DVD Player TFT Touch Screen Easy Install Mounted &Children Headphones Included(Blue&Pink)",Mobile_Electronics,5,"These are quintessentially custom DVD players that have high-end OEM auto-manufacturers' specs that you can install to almost look like they came with the car.  The mounting systems on these players are one of the largest differences between them & lesser players; they are solid-cast metal harnesses with mobile, &#34;floating&#34; T-locks that do both a great job of supporting the player, allowing versatility and security in mounting the units to the headrest support poles.  Most other competitors for half the price have nylon band that you have to cinch down around the unit and headrest support poles that are a pain and tend to slouch over time.  Minimal cords (largely due to a single power cord & IR headphones not requiring any plug-ins) give it a clean appearance in a nice luxury sedan and increases the ease of my children getting out of the back seat exponentially.  Probably the most important aspect of this player is picture quality, which is outstanding; and I would relate to that of a Retina display on an iPad- very vivid and seems that they almost solved the sun glare problem.  They also do not show any signs of aging from being constantly installed in the car during the hot months of summer, only time will tell for the winter.  Finally, the biggest difference to us and a major reason for purchasing these units at a higher price, was the steady-state drive.  Those who are not familiar with this aspect may completely overlook this most-important characteristic that differentiates this player from other products; since this will be our third pair of rear entertainment players in five years, I can attest to the importance of this in terms of durability for those looking for this product to entertain young children.  The past two set of players (not solid-state) had front 'doors' that opened with a latch which always 'happened' to get broke off from certain someones trying to change a disc by themselves, while their loving parents were trying to keep the vehiclebetween the lines; and read the disc with a floating eye-reader, rather than a fixed eye from a uniform read point constantly.  Just for the durability factor, I will always opt for solid-state drive rather than door and floating eye reader; the solid-state players 'feed' the discs into a slot on the side or bottom.  Only time will tell to the durability of this, but my hypothesis should prove to be sound.  The only slight minus to a solid-state is that it seems to be much more finicky with reading scratched or smudged discs than floating-eyed readers; but then we just need to keep the DVDs in better shape, folks!"

You can tell you are dealing with junk the moment you take out of the box as supports are flimsy and not affixed correctly.  Very difficult to install relative to the two other pairs I installed in other cars from another brand.  Finally, when I did finally get the units installed, the screen on one died within a week.  Warranty is terrible and company doesn't respond to communication.  When I finally threatened to report to the state agency for consumer fraud, they replied and said their standard policy for warranties is to make customer pay for return shipping (customary) AND return postage (definitely NOT customary).  I would not recommend this product to even Kim Kardashian - who I despise also.  That's another review for another time.  Do yourself a favor, research another brand and purchase it.

I am an avid music listener and tend to buy the higher quality products because I do not like distorted sound when I listen to my music.  This speaker is very high quality and came charged and ready to play straight out of the box.  I have to say I was very impressed when it arrived.  The design is very nice it has touch buttons to control from the top of the speaker or you can use your device's buttons.  Either way it goes I think you will be very impressed with the quality of sound that travels out of this product.  You can hear all of your 1's and 2's clearly without any static cracking or interference.  The battery life on it is quite good as well I had no problems with it playing for over 3 hours.  It is not cheaply made.  I am thrilled to have gotten this device at a lower cost in return for my unbiased opinion of the product.  I really love this product and the delivery of the treble, base, and midtones.  I would highly recommend anyone to try this product.  This company really doe's make a great speaker for an awesome price.  This is most definitely comparable to speakers that you would normally pay very high prices for.

B00M4C7APA,Garmin nüvi 52LM 5-Inch Portable Vehicle GPS with Lifetime Maps (US),Mobile_Electronics,5,"I bought this Garmin after my TomTom XL was stolen from my car. I have to say, I'm very pleased so far.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will answer a few questions that you may have yourself, so that you can see if this is the right GPS for you.<br /><br />Off the bat, the first thing I noticed is how quickly the satellites find your location. Sometimes my TomTom would take a few minutes to locate me, but with the 52LM, it never seems to go over 10-15 seconds.<br /><br />One of the features I really loved about my TomTom was the mutli-line information on the screen. It would list my current time, the time I would arrive, how fast I was going, all on the screen. I was sad at first to find Garmins on screen information was very simple, but later rejoiced as I found you can have FOUR customizable &#34;widgets&#34; on the screen, which closley resembles the mutli-line format from TomTom. For example, you can pick Current Time, Arrival Time, Distance, Elevation (if that's your thing) , Speed, etc.<br /><br />Also, the big 5 inch screen is a plus, almost too big if you don't find the correct spot in your car.<br /><br />Another thing I HATED about my TomTom was that when you added a Favorite, and titled it e.g. &#34;Work&#34; it would delete the address, so if a friend needed the exact address to one of your favorites then you were out of luck, because it simply showed the title of the favorite and not the location. With my Garmin, it STILL shows the location as well as letting you name it! Fantastic!<br /><br />Of course, this Garmin comes with access to other cool stuff including Emergency services.<br /><br />All in all, I think an in car GPS is the best investment you can make, for yourself or for your kids , especially new drivers. Gets rid of the anxiety of being lost and it's accurate 99% of the time.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a powerful GPS that isn't loaded with a lot of &#34;gimmick&#34; features (*cough* like Bluetooth dialing *cough*) then I highlyrecommend this one. Just take caution, because a GPS is like candy to car thieves, which I learned the hard way with my TomTom."

B00K98535A,Pioneer TS-SW2002D2 8-inch Shallow-Mount Subwoofer with 600 Watts Max Power,Mobile_Electronics,4,Perfect fit replacement on an 03 4Runner with JBL Synthesis.  If I was more of an audiophile this would not do as the bass is not tight and clean like the JBL but it thumps more than before.  If you are thrifty this will do for you but if you spend $30 more it opens up an entire diff category of better performing subs w/o the need to replace the amp or add a crossover.  I prolly will not own the vehicle much longer but i take my tunes w/bass!  So my rating is acceptably average.

If I was in channel mode it would switch the B channel to be the same as the A channel then freeze. it would also randomly make a click sound and kinda freak out. also, the volume is SUPER loud. it was hard to get it low enough before it would just go quiet. really bummed. hopefully they get the bugs fixed. this unit is being returned."

Good spacing too for the bulky vertical plugs, as well.<br /><br />Another subtle aspect that need to be highlighted is the USB ports.  It has two 2.4A ports (labeled as \\""Super Charge\\"") and two 1A ports (labeled as \\""Universal\\"").  It is a bit odd nomenclature, but the practicality is the entire 5V output is 6.8A.  In other words, you indeed can have all four ports going concurrently, each one up to it's own maximum amperage, which is not commonly the case with power hubs of any sort.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations."

B010P73G76,"Phtronics 2015 Latest Version 8GB & 70 Hours Playback MP3 Lossless Sound Music Player (Supports up to 64GB), Color Black",Mobile_Electronics,5,"I just got one of these. It works great playing audio books while I exercise, which is all I will use it for. It was easy to load up the content using my PC. I like the included earbuds and the volume is sufficient that I can hear it over traffic on busy streets. After messing around with it for a while, I was able to figure out how to select a book, start and stop the audio and change the volume. It loses my place if I shut it off so I'll probably just leave it on.<br /><br />The problem with the user interface is that the function of the buttons is not consistent from screen to screen. Sometimes the volume button(!) takes you back a screen, sometimes it is back button. There are long pushes and short pushes. Nobody wants to figure out and memorize all of this - my wife wanted to throw it across the room. It would have been much better to standardize the buttons the way Apple did with their remotes."

B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"The S8 is one outstanding little Bluetooth speaker. First, it is loud...very loud. The sound fills our entire house. The bass response is fantastic. The overall quality is way more than I expected. Well worth the price, which is not much to begin with compared to others that are way overpriced (looking at you BeatsAudio).<br />The only issues I found were these:<br />1. The touch sensitive buttons, though very cool compared to physical push buttons, are easy to trigger when picking the device up from the top. After a few times of accidentally doing this I learned to grab it from the side, problem solved.<br />2. The play/pause button doesn't control Pandora app very well. It paused fine but wouldn't resume play. It works fine on my Google Play Music app (I have a MotoX 1st Gen) so this may just be the Pandora app.<br />3. I noticed that when charging the device it emitted a humming noise. A YouTube reviewer noticed it to. I did however find a good quality charging adapter and the humming went away completely, so I think this is a voltage requirement or a interference issue with certain adapters or cables."

I'm a skateboarder, surfer, SUP, beach cruiser, pool lurker, snowboarder, camper, and occasionally I shower. This thing is perfect for all. I have the kind of ADHD that needs background sound at all times, so I take music and speakers rather seriously. I've been loyal to my expensive, yet high quality, Nixon speakers for years. I needed a speaker that I can hear from one side of the ramp or bowl to the other and this thing does it in spades. The carabiner is perfect to clip to coolers, backpacks, canoe or SUP deck rigging, tent hooks... or... any place you want to hang a speaker Tommy Boy.<br /><br />As for this little gems features: I use my phone for everything music related. This thing pairs up to my phones Bluetooth super easy, has a great battery life, and sounds impressively clear even covered in water, sand, and snow.

B00Y2100OO,LiteXim All in One Large Touch Screen Hands Free Digital Mp3/Mp4 Music Player Music/Audio/FM radio & Micro SD Card (Black),Mobile_Electronics,4,"This is an MP3 player with a back clip that does a good job of playing songs but the sound quality is average. Not surprising given the low price. The included earphones are really cheap so you have to use your own. This little MP3 player needs a micro SD card to work as the resident memory is just for the operating software. It plays songs and other videos just like any other MP3 player.<br /><br />The touch screen does work ok. For the under $10 price it's still a good value, especially if you just want to load up a few songs to gift someone. There is also a USB cable included to charge this little player. I would recommend also as a MP3 player for walks and exercising as the clip is strong and attaches easily to clothing.<br />[Received free or discounted product to test for a candid review]"

B010FIVM0I,"GJT®2.7"" Full HD 1080P DV Car Camera K6000 DVR Camcorder Video Recorder with Night Vision",Mobile_Electronics,5,"[[VIDEOID:fc39bfebf09db0a63f5ba833cc8c7f32]] I purchased this camera this week.  I have a car camera in every vehicle our family owns and each camera is different based on what was available at the time.  I have only had one wreck.  It was at a four way stop and I stopped and was turning left.  The vehicle coming the opposite way was approaching his stop sign as I was going through.  He ran through his stop and hit my rear quarter panel.  Know what he said when the cop arrived.  He said I ran the stop sign.  You should have seen the look on the guys face when I told the officer that I had a car camera.  Case closed.<br /><br />Anyway.  I have learned to buy simple inexpensive car cameras.  I dont need GPS or G sensors.  I do not like G sensors because any vibration in the car or camera mount can alert the G sensor and it will lock the file.  If that happens enough then your sd car fills up with locked files that will not be overwritten like normal files.  That can stop all recording until you erase the locked files.  The description says the camera has a G sensor but it does not. Also, the LEDs for night driving are not automatic and there are only two LEDs. They have to be turned on manually.  Now if you have had cameras with the LEDs for night driving then you know they are pretty worthless because they do not shine enough to illuminate anything more than a few feet in front of the camera which is not helpfull for video at night.  Your headlights provide the illumination.  In my experience most of these cameras are ok at night but you will not be able to read words or license plates.<br /><br />The setup is easy on the camera and the instructions understandable.  I recorded a clip at 720x480 which is one less than the highest resolution the camera offers.  You judge for yourself.<br /><br />I do not know how long the camera will last but I will update if it stops working.  Also dont turn motion sensitivity on unless you need it.  With it off the camera operates like a normal car cam.  It turns on and starts recording when you start the car and then turns off a few seconds after you turn the ignition off."

In low light, there's not much visibility, and with no light, you can't see a thing! Inside the box, the company includes a drill bit for you to drill out the hole for the camera. Nice little perk! Even if you can't do any wiring in your car, you can still rig this up and mount it, and use a 12V car adapter for it.

This one will skip VERY easily (even if sitting on a flat surface) so it is not very portable.  I think something on the mode button makes it do things I don't want but the writing on the mode display is so small, it is nearly invisible. That is my biggest complaint because I think it would work better if I could adjust it. There must not be many of us who want to listen to CD's without downloading them to a device or they would make a better choice of personal players. I love to listen to Books on CD while walking or gardening. I think this player has brought me more aggravation than pleasure.  I bought it in March and it still works (kind of) but I think it has lasted so long, because most of the time, it doesn't play satisfactorily and I give up in frustration."

B004ECO5VA,Holux Mini Smart Mouse Type GPS Receiver GR-213U by Koolertron,Mobile_Electronics,5,"I have been using this Holux GR-213U USB GPS receiver for the past two years.<br /><br />I have found it to be of excellent production quality (Made in Taiwan), truly durable and waterproof as stated and has a convenient and strong magnet embedded in the base that allows it to adhere most any iron or steel surface.<br /><br />From a technical point of view, it contains the bullet-proof SiRF-Star III chipset specifically designed for receiving the US constellation of GPS Satellite signals. This is one of the best chipsets in the business -- no Russian GLONASS or Chinese GPS support in this chipset. Later models are based on a different chipset that supports both US and Russian satellites. However this unit works great!<br /><br />Driver software supplied emulates a serial port allowing compatibility with a huge range of GPS software.<br /><br />It also supports the industry standard NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) command set for programming and additional functions can be invoked including the ZDA (1 pulse per second time signal). This also makes it useful for many purposes including serving as an accurate time source for many applications requiring time sync including Amateur radio JT65 and WSPR use.<br /><br />The package comes attractively boxed with all software on a mini CD ROM and adequate instructions plus some velcro and a suction cap to anchor down the lead in your application. I found that the driver was compatible with many 3rd party GPS programs supporting the NMEA protocol.<br /><br />LED flashes when sync is achieved, usually about 10 seconds after connecting to the computer.<br /><br />It does everything that I expect from a USB powered GPS unit."

Spend the few hundred dollars more and go with something better.  The IPod display is horrible as well and it will not come up with songs regardless of how your IPod is setup, mine is set to shuffle and I still have to pick, IPod then playlist then all songs then a song and only then will it shuffle.....very annoying.

One IMPORTANT thing to know that will save you tons of headache: If the panel you are installing this tweeter on is too thin, the mounting screws will bottom out on the solder connections of the voice coil to the terminals and cause catastrophic failure! I'm ashamed to say, but I couldn't figure it at first and assumed I had defective tweeters. When I realize what was happening it was very obvious. The supplied mounting screws are long enough to short to the terminals and/or force their way into the solder connections enough to destroy the contact. I ruined 3 tweeters before I figured out what was happening, but fortunately I was able to salvage them by re-soldering the connections. These would be awesome tweeters if the documentation was better and warned you of this pitfall. I wasted a TON of time because of this issue, and not happy. Otherwise, they sound decent when they work."

B00WE48O44,"Arespark Portable Smart Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker with NFC (Built-in Mic Hands-free Speakerphone, Dual Stereo Speakers, Indoor/outdoors Splash Proof Speaker, Compatible with Apple Iphone 6 Plus,5s; Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4, HTC One M8, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Lg G3, Ipad Air, Ipod, Mp3 Players) Black",Mobile_Electronics,4,"I bought this speaker based on reviews on Amazon. I don't know how many glowing reviews were from people who received a free product, but it doesn't matter, I'm glad I bought it. It's heavy, not too heavy to slip into a bag. I think my only complaint is the camouflage paint, but I knew that's the only color it came in. The sound quality is surprisingly clear and can get pretty loud without distortion. It's pretty cute, actually. It was packaged very well, very protected. I like the rubber bumper bottom that keeps it from sliding and I think it will be a great little addition to outdoor fall activities. The carabiner is more useful than I thought it'd be... I can hang it on the towel hangers outside the shower and enjoy my tunes (I had a hard time choosing between this and arespark's waterproof version)."
B00LAG4F6S,iXCC Multi pack Lightning cable,Mobile_Electronics,5,"I have owned many lightning cables.  Most work for awhile and either stop working or will show a pop-up on my iPhone screen saying &#34;this cable may not be compatible(...&#34;, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />Not this cable.  I bought a pack of two so several of us can use them.  we have had these for one week and have used them every day and both cables work perfectly.  The 6 ft length is great, as you can still use your phone while plugged in. Some wall outlets may not be near you and with a 6ft cable it doesn't hinder using your phone like the shorter cable might.<br /><br />The pack of two cables is even less expensive than some single cable I purchased that no longer or never worked.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these cable and thank my son for telling me about these.  He purchased the 3ft lengths and he is happy with those."

B004T0FWF0,Cadence 14g152m-blue 14 Gauge 150 Foot Blue Speaker Wire Spool (Cut From a 500 Foot Spool),Mobile_Electronics,1,Cadence wire is copper coated aluminum. thats why the price is so low. It's only good if you're upgrading from some real crappy wiring. anything else is a downgrade. definitely not for audiophile use or long cable runs. I only used it for short cable connections inside of an enclosure. If you use this for long cable runs or inside of a car you are asking for shorts. aluminum is very brittle and breaks very easily. solder won't stick to it so the ends can't be tinned. the only option is to crimp a connector but the wire can't move at all because it will eventually fray and break off at the crimp point

B00VU7PXDG,[New Element Series] iXCC MicroUSB cables,Mobile_Electronics,5,Do you need a Micro USB cable to charge your phone? Well these are the cables you need to get. They are really nice and they work with any device. Some cable you get from companies it they will only allow you to charge your device and that’s it. So if you want to transfer data from your computer to your device you won’t be able too. Well with theses you can do both. So they are just as high quality as name brand cables.  These also work good with the Xbox One controller. That’s what I’ve been using these cables. I use them to plug my Xbox One controller to charge them or use them as a wired controller. These work great for that. So overall if you are looking for some nice high quality Micro USB cables these are the ones you need to get. Not only are they cheap they are cheap high quality cables.<br /><br />&#34;I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation”

B00B4E9764,BlackVue Wi-Fi DR500GW-HD Car Black Box/DVR Recorder,Mobile_Electronics,1,"I purchased this on December 8, 2013 - exactly. When I first got it I used the SD card included (and later a SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card). Updated firmware from website then installed it in the front as Blackvue suggested. Used the iphone to change features within the camera, which was a little of a hassle due to the password -claimed it was such and such in the papers that came with it, and it wasn't. I had to go online and find others that had the same issue and used the password they got in with. Took about an hour to finally get in. Not a big issue once I got in.<br /><br />Checked video, it was terrible. Figured it was the card and firmware update. Checked online and I wasn't the only one experiencing this.<br />Contacted Blackuve and they said &#34;because you purchased from Amazon and you live in the US, we cannot and will not help you&#34; - cut short and dry; they said it ruder / more unprofessional.<br /><br />So I dealt with it, and waited for another firmware update thinking it would help. Updated SD card to the SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card) helped some, but not by too much.<br /><br />Moved the camera done some from the rear view mirror (closer to the dashboard) and it helped a little more. So at this time, it was in the middle of my windshield, but still in the middle. Video was okay, still couldn't see license plates and that is huge with me. (a lot of hit and runs here).<br /><br />Since purchase, it would stop working, out of the blue. I would always leave it plugged in (I *did not* use parking mode; and with my cars, the power cuts off after 10 minutes auto) and from time to time, after starting the car, the recording would not even start until the GPS would kick in, which meant it would not start for almost half my journey. At times, the GPS would kick in, and the record would never start. There were times it didn't record at all, but the recording light would flash. I would get home and there would be nothing recorded. I would check on the phone and I would see live view, but it was not filling up. That happened more than 7 times.<br /><br />It would restart itself randomly. Very annoying, especially when you thought it was recording. I would be in the car over an hour and it would just say &#34;Blackvue for your driving safety&#34; for the first time, after an hour of driving, so I missed all that time. :|<br /><br />It died February 19th, 2014. I had my son look at it and we worked on it together and got it back up and running. And yes, all that happened within 2 months.<br /><br />Again died 2 weeks later. Fixed.<br /><br />Got sick of it and purchased 2 GoPro's used the Blackvue in the back, which strangely, the video was great. I could actually see front license plates, but where I live, SC, front license plates aren't expected; so I only saw tourists or vanity plates.<br /><br />Blackvue died again a month and half later. Had my son look at it because I was sick of it. He said he didn't want to mess with it again, but I talked him into it because I needed it for speed/mph reporting. He said it was due to power. The cord wasn't connecting.<br /><br />Got it working again. Left it plugged in so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore and only unplugged it if there were an emergency, which meant if I had to update the firmware, format the card (which you could do in the camera, but mine would not do that), change cards or get info, I couldn't do that.<br /><br />Two months after that, not even a full two months, the SD card function, that holds the card in and let it come out, the spring, broke, so I could not get the card to go in, and I almost couldn't get the damn thing to come out, I had to force it out. Asked my son once again to fix it.. he took a look and said it was not fixable because the way they had it put together inside. I told him he could keep it. He said he didn't want it - and this is a guy who will take anything for his electronics and he didn't want that. So I tossed it. I spent over $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any. I purchased it here and I'm in the US. That's a loop hole apparently because according to Miss Rudy Huxtable (that's a pun, she was rude as a donkey) I wasn't supposed to, or allowed to have it!<br />- Had to constantly check on firmware for it and install it to make sure the video was at least useable - still wasn't. When I'd update the firmware, it was a hit and miss because when you update, you have to delete the previous installment off the card by either formatting it again or just deleting it.<br />- the power cord is long enough for the back (standard vehicle) to the front *but* if you unplug it a lot, like once a week, it will wear out and not power up anymore, like mine did more than a few times.<br />- it lets you know the SD card isn't there even though, uh, it is.<br />- says it's recording, but it's not.<br />- says audio is starting even if you have it turned off via app or camera and aren't even touching it... even wondered if I had a ghost a few times in the car with me ...or bugs.<br />- wi-fi does the same; off.. on, off, on.. doesn't connect.<br />- gets hot even if it's not recording.<br />- video did better in the back BUT I had to get out to fix the plug unexpectedly a lot because of the power issue so it would go in and out of power and I'd be lucky when it would restart, if it would start recording because of THAT issue as well.<br />- other issues, but like I said, it's been over a year and my memory isn't great with this product because I HATED it.<br /><br />For that price, I would rather have a small person or a fairy sit in the back and take notes and hold a recorder. . . . that's why I turned around and got GoPro's.. (psssst. the $129 is *much* better than the more expensive ones.. I got the expensive one first and the cheaper later and it does *much* better than that!) I have the cheaper one in back and it picks up everything .. the expensive one in front.. I just need a dash cam to pick up speed/mph, GoPro's don't do that.<br /><br />I really wanted to like Blackvue, because it's wi-fi, speed and GPS but honestly, it's a piece of junk - at least here [on 'A'] it is.r $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any.

B00Y2100OO,LiteXim All in One Large Touch Screen Hands Free Digital Mp3/Mp4 Music Player Music/Audio/FM radio & Micro SD Card (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"There are only a couple of things I didnt like about this MP3 player. The instructions included with this MP3 player don't apply to this model. Plus, you have to buy an SD chip for the memory. The FLASH DRIVE is just large enough to hold the system memory. You cant store music files on this, unless you buy a SD chip. (They cost $6 for a 16 gig chip.) With that out of the way,  I'm very impressed this player. For starters, they fixed the one big problem, that the older cheap MP3 players had. On older models, you could not access the folders that held your songs. If you had a 8 gig chip, the only way to browse through the music, was song by song. Now they have files set up, so you can scan by band. Once you click on the band file, you can chose the album. Once you chose the album file, you can chose the song. With literally hundreds of albums able to be stored on a 16 gig chip, that makes this a very functional MP3 player. As for the sound, I'm really happy with the quality. The digital decoder, and amplifier is of sufficient quality, to let you listen to music without distortion. Of course, the weak link of the chain would be the headphones. (Don't even bother using the earphones that come with this. Buy good quality headphones or earphones, and use those.) Another issue with these cheap MP3 players, concerns the battery life. Of course its rechargeable, but there's a trick to recharging some Li-ion batteries. (READ BOTTOM OF REVIEW.)<br /><br />So you get a nice MP3 player, that can clip onto your pants or shirt, when you're out and about. It has FM radio (the headphone wire is the antennae, so don't expect to use a Bluetooth transmitter with this, and listen to the radio.) You can record with this too. (again, if you buy a chip.) I suppose you could download a video on this (like a Utoob clip, or gif file), but I don't think it would be worth the effort. Why watch it on a one inch screen? Also, you could download a book, but the screen maybe would show 5-7 words at a time. It would take forever just to read a page. Right now, this player is available for less than a ten dollar bill, which really surprises me. An affordable MP3 player? Excellent. Actually, trading out the SD chips, is a cool option. If you have a lot of music, you can create various SD chips with MP3 files, for your jazz music, alternative, EDM, or folk and classical. By the way, the MP3 player does read WMP files, in case you rip in that format. (As I do.)<br />UPDATE: (September 29th 2015)<br />I've been using this MP3 player at the gym, four days a week, for a couple of months now. It always recharges well, plus it keeps a charge for at least a few hours. I have not had a single problem with this MP3 player. The battery is EXCELLENT on this model. Listen, I've been burnt with inexpensive MP3 players, so I was very cautious reviewing the LiteXim product. I expected it not to perform, and I was wrong to doubt the quality of this product. Considering how inexpensive it is, I have to admit, its one of the best bargains, that I have had the pleasure to review. So I raised the review from four stars to five.  If you want an MP3 player, and don't mind supplying your own SD chip (which are so inexpensive now), this is a good choice.<br /><br />If you do run into a problem with the player, it will be with the battery not wanting to take a recharge. Here's the fix.<br /><br />RECHARGING a LITHIUM ION BATTERY, that wont recharge.<br />Sometimes, the battery will wear out.  You can try to recharge them, but nothing happens. The trick is to remove ALL remaining charge from the battery, before you recharge. To do this, you need to turn the MP3 player ON. You'll get a WELCOME screen, a &#34;LOW BATTERY LEVEL&#34; screen, then a &#34;BYE BYE&#34; screen. Then turn it off. Then turn it on, repeating the process, until the player only FLASHES the welcome screen for a second. Keep going, turning it on, after it turns off, until it WILL NOT TURN ON AT ALL. When its completelydead, plug it into the charger. Now, be patient. It takes DAYS to recharge. I have found, that if you keep the MP3 player turned ON during charging, that it will charge better. (Maybe let it charge in OFF mode, for a couple of days. Then, let it charge in ON mode. ) Be patient. Eventually, in 2-3 days, the battery will recharge. The charge will be good for 4-5 hours, maybe less.<br />NO INSTRUCTIONS<br />You have four buttons. POWER is also the PLAY button. You have the - / + buttons on top, on either side of the &#34;M&#34; button. You need to go into the &#34;M&#34; screen, to access everything like VOLUME, REPEAT, etc. Use the - / + buttons to navigate. The &#34;M&#34; button selects. Volume is hard to control on this MP3 player. You need to find that MODE screen, then select VOLUME, then select the volume with navigator buttons. However, once you discover this for yourself, its fairly easy. I deducted a star, because of no instructions (at least no instructions that apply to this model), and because it doesn't come with any usable memory. Actually, I'd like to say FOUR AND A HALF STARS. ITs a nice MP3 player, even if you do have to supply your own SD Chip. So for the price, how much can you complain?<br />I was provided a free MP3 player in exchange for a fair and honest review.tient. It takes DAYS to recharge.

I like that it has both blue-tooth and audio capacity: I've plugged it into my laptop too, and movie nights have become way more fun.<br />The only cons I have are that it takes an awkwardly long amount of time to connect to my phone via Bluetooth (about 30 seconds, which is 25 longer than it took my last speaker), and the dual-purpose volume/track buttons. I've made the mistake of not pressing the volume buttons long enough, and it's annoying to have to skip or restart the song. But those are just nit-picky. The sound quality itself is good, and the price was great. I will say that the color is closer to a lighter aqua/turquoise, rather than the deep blue show in the picture, but I prefer it that way anyway!"

You really have to look at the speaker in person, to appreciate its futuristic look. That is mostly thanks to the honeycomb design on top of the speaker grill at the front of the speaker. On top of that, the polygonal-shaped buttons located at the top of the speaker add to the futuristic look. Overall, the design of the speaker is on-point, and nothing like anything seen on other Bluetooth speakers on the market. It doesn't end there - the build quality of the speaker is as solid as it looks. Its matte plastic (soft-touch plastic) construction all around allows the speaker to not draw fingerprints and scratches, and allows the speaker to feel very well-built and sturdy. I don't see this speaker falling apart anytime soon.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE - 10/10<br />With this speaker, I was able to get around 8 hours of music playback time, which falls short of the promised 10 hours of music playback time. However, don't get me wrong here - 8 hours of music playback time is PHENOMENAL compared to other Bluetooth speakers in this price range. 8 hours. Of straight music-playing. Trust me, you won't have any complaints with the battery life of this speaker.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 9.5/10<br />At first when I got this speaker, the sound quality was almost mediocre - the overall sound was muffled, and it was horrible. But then when I used this speaker for about 2 hours or so, and let the speakers \\""burn-in\\"", the sound got much clearer. It got clearer to the point where its sound quality is one of the best in its class - well-balanced mids, highs, and lows, as well as just enough bass for my taste. The bass IS a bit overpowering, but I personally like that sort of sound. Vocals and instrumentals are quite clear, nothing crazy, but for a Bluetooth speaker of this price range, it's fantastic.<br /><br />FUNCTIONALITY - 10/10<br />Just like any other Bluetooth speaker and any other device in today's market, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB. The standard stuff, and it works fine, so no complaints there. There's also an AUX port, in case your device's Bluetooth doesn't work, or your device simply doesn't have Bluetooth. Finally, the speaker also comes with a TF (Micro SD Card) slot, allowing you to play music on the speaker WITHOUT ANY OTHER DEVICE! This is quite fantastic in my opinion, as you can just carry around this speaker (with a Micro SD Card, of course), jamming to your favorite tune. Overall, the functionality of this speaker is great.<br /><br />VERDICT/OVERALL EXPERIENCE - 10/10<br />Overall, I really can't find much to complain about this speaker. From its build quality, battery life, sound quality, and functionality, the speaker excels in every single aspect. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a mid-range Bluetooth speaker that sounds better than a low-range speaker, or even your phone's speaker.arket, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB.

It still seems to function, but really needs a good heatsink to work at the rated amp/hour max for a few hours. It was so hot earlier, the copper coil able to be moved around a little, meaning the solder was starting to melt. I disconnected it from that setup for now, until I find a better solution."

Worked like a charm (or at least a magic trick). For 2006 Toyota:<br />1) Duplicate key.<br />2) Get in the vehicle and shut the door.<br />3) Insert Master Key (with dot) 5 times, leaving it inserted on 5th time.<br />4) Open and close the driver door 6 times.<br />5) Pull out master key. The transponder dash light should stay on.<br />6) Insert the duplicate key. transponder light begins flashing.<br />7) Wait for transponder light to flash (30 flashes or about 1 minute).<br /><br />In my case the hardware store wouldn't duplicate the key. I tried myself unsuccessfully, however this key snaps open and back closed very nicely and the metal key is held in place with two screws.

(It started my 4.0 Liter V6.)<br /><br />I also use it inside my camper van as a 12-volt power supply for lighting and a fan. Works well (see below).<br /><br />There are over a dozen brands on amazon that are nearly identical to this model, so you can shop around. Those that look identical to this model may have minor differences in the carrying case, connectors provided, emergency light features, etc. The 4 \\""clones\\"" I tested all seem to have come from the same factory because they have so many details in common.<br /><br />This model comes with a 4-way USB cable (Micro-, Mini-, Apple 30-pin, and Apple Lightning.)

It's the amp-hours delivered at 3.7 volts by the internal Li-ion cells before the conversion to higher voltage output. This unit's 16.8-amp hour spec means you would get a maximum of 5.18 amp-hours at 12-volts, for example. It's 62 watt-hours of power, no matter which voltage output you're using.<br /><br />- - - Connector Sizes - - -<br /><br />It comes with lots of connector tips for 12-16-19 volt output, but it's nice the know the main unit uses very common connector sizes, in case you want to attach your own cables.

B00DSAZVKI,Fujifilm - One-Time-Use Underwater 35mm Camera,Mobile_Electronics,1,"This Fujifilm one-time use camera is a total POS, piece of garbage, and should be used zero times!  I rate it with NEGATIVE 5 stars, since zero stars would be too good for it . This camera should not even be allowed to be sold.  I took it with me on my cruise vacation, hoping to capture some nice shots in and near the water, but all I got was the reflection of the translucent covering on top of the lens.  For some stupid reason, the manufacture designed the camera with a waterproof case made of very poor clarity plastic that totally screws up the quality of every single picture it takes.  The lens focused only on the plastic case on every picture, so every picture was just a picture of the plastic case, with what I really wanted to take a picture of just the showing has some blurry blob in the background.  Did any moron at Fujifilm ever actually test this camera first, before putting it on the market? Can I get my money back, and a written apology, Amazon? This product is a total disgrace!

The screen fits fine but the connections at the end of the flex cable are not the correct pitch, they are too close together.  So they are nearly 1 pin off from the originals (there are 4 pins).  When I attempted to solder them, they did not line  up properly with the original contact point on the flex circuit so the pins wanted to cross connect with the solder. After having to slit the new contact flex to spread it out, I got  the unit to work with the touch screen, then due to the stress on the contacts being pulled sideways the copper traces in the new flex to the touch screen fractured internally when closing up the unit... after an hour of futzing around I gave up... wasted money!  If the contacts had been correct it would have been a piece of cake.  BTW, I have been fixing broken electronics for 50 years... I'm not a novice."

However, the vendor is super-fast and DHL managed to get it from the warehouse in China on a Friday morning to my doorstep in Florida by Monday afternoon - very good first impression, and major props to DHL as the shipper!<br /><br />Installation in my wife's 2014 Jetta SE was easy, and the longest part of the job was tucking the USB cable for the (optional) front DVR camera into the headliner. I would recommend using one of the trim tool kit's from Amazon, such as this one http://www.amazon.com/KINGLAKE®-Panel-Removal-Radio-Installer/dp/B00HNMLQAG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1438978963&sr=8-3&keywords=car+stereo+trim+tool which helps getting the USB cable under the headliner without any drama.<br /><br />The Joying web site said only SD/TF cards up to 32Gb, but I filled a 128Gb card with MP3, AAC, and FLAC songs and plugged it into the SD slot and then powered the head-unit on. The first start-up took about 45 seconds, and I was a little worried that it would take that long each time I started the car, but subsequent starts were around 20 seconds. Would be nice if it was a bit faster, but not too bad a delay.<br /><br />A little later I found a configuration setting that let's you set a sleep delay from 5 minutes, up to a few hours. What this does is put the head-unit in a sleep mode, but keeps it powered on for a quick restart of around 5 seconds. I set it to 15 minutes, and it's super nice when you are stopping and starting your car multiple times during the day - get back in and turn the ignition on within the 15 minute timer and the music is pumping within seconds. Since these head-units use a decent amount of power, I don't think I'd leave it in this mode for more that 15 or 30 minutes as it will cause some additional drain on your battery in this mode.<br /><br />So how did I like the operation of the head-unit?  The GPS software is nice, and after 15 years with stand-alone Garmin units, the IGO software is a nice change. The radio app supports RDS, and has 18 presets you can set manually, or press the magnifying glass icon to have it automatically set the first 18 stations it finds. Reception seems good, and it gets the same stations the VW RCD310 radio was picking up in my driveway.<br /><br />The Video app found a couple of MP4 video files on the SD card, and plays them as you would expect. I found the movies to be a little dark but that was mid-day in the Florida sun. Checking again in the evening, and they looked great.<br /><br />The Music app works, but could do with some improvements. It takes about 30 seconds to scan all the songs on my 128Gb SD card before it starts playing them. Unfortunately it rescans the SD card every time you turn the car on, so that was a pain. Took a few minutes to login to my Google account, and through Google Play was able to download the PowerAmp music player. Problem solved!  It saves the last song played and starts with that song the next time the car is started. Double bonus is that it can be configured to NOT rescan the SD and USB storage devices, so it's ready to go within a few seconds.<br /><br />I plugged an older iPod Classic into one of the USB cables Joying provide, but nothing happened. With the Pioneer unit in my car the music player detects the iPod and presents the contents of the iPod in the same format as SD files. With the Joying I couldn't get the iPod to work at all, so I emailed their support staff to get their help. First thing the next morning I had an email telling me the iPod needed a special cable that could be ordered from their web site, so I ordered one. When it arrived I saw that it had a 16-pin block connector on one end that needed to be plugged in to the motherboard inside the head-unit. Ten minutes to remove the head0unit from the dashboard, 5 minutes to find a small screwdriver, 2 minutes to open the case, 1 minute to plug the new cable it, 2 minutes to close up the case, and 5 minutes to put it all back into the dash - a bit annoying as I would have ordered the 'special cable' at the same time as head-unit if I had known that it was required.<br /><br />After enabling the iPod support in the configuration settings, and starting the iPod application it still did not work. The Joying head-unit displayed the name of my iPod but never displayed any of the songs or playlists on it. I should mention this is a modified iPod Classic and has 128Gb of flash memory. Plugging in a newer iPod Touch worked fine, so it probably does not like the older operating system on the Classic.<br /><br />The Car Recorder application is cool, and records video from the front-facing camera I installed. The camera itself is a basic unit, and the Car Recorder app also worked with a Logitech C920 camera I tested it with. It saves the video in compressed format onto the SD card in the GPS slot, and this is not configurable so I replaced the Joying supplied 8Gb card with a 64Gb Class-10 Samsung card. With 4 gigs for the GPS software there is lots of space for recording your trips, or just day to day driving. Using the File Explorer application I could see that there were multiple MP4 files and LOG files with the same name. The  LOG files contain the GPS coordinates and date & time information, and looking at the video's for playback in the Car Recorder app overlays that metadata onto the MP4 video being shown, but it will not be present if you just copy the MP4 file of the GPS card and give it to someone in the event of a proble - always give them the LOG file that matches the MP4 file.<br /><br />My one real annoyance is the Bluetooth app while streaming music from my phone - music comes through fine, and the forward and back controls do what you expect but there is no song title or artist information. Looks like they have a little work to do getting that displayed.<br /><br />I don't have any 3G / 4G  USB devices to test internet access with, but it connects to my home WiFi while in the driveway, and it also connects to my iPhone running as a personal hotspot if you want Spotify, Wave or other services that require internet access. Looking at the User Guide I see the head-unit can function as a wireless hotspot itself, so I'm assuming that only works with a 3G or 4G-USB device.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice unit with a couple of minor irritants. Since I bought it there has been an upgrade that I applied, and it looks like the Joying folks will continue to release updated code for these head-units. Very happy with this purchase!"

B00NUQHSJM,Kingtop Portable Bluetooth Speakers with Unique Wooden Appearance Powerful Sound Speakers for Iphone Ipad Android,Mobile_Electronics,5,"With a unique wood-grain look, this speaker's looks immediately sets it apart from others in the portable Bluetooth speaker pack. The bottom portion of the speaker has a slight angle to it, giving you more control over sound direction than most speakers in this market segment. Between the top and bottom areas of the speaker is a thin light band that glows (or blinks) blue or red depending on the speaker's connection or pairing status. While the design looks great and is very stylish, it's bright enough that it would probably be distracting if you wanted to listen to this speaker in a dark room.<br /><br />The individual raised buttons look good. While their wood grain pattern is slightly different than the rest of the speaker, it blends nicely and subtly sets the buttons apart. They all have raised symbols on them denoting their functions. My only gripe with them is that the Volume Up button is on the left and the Volume Down button is on the right, which is opposite of most speakers I've used or seen.<br /><br />The speaker volume has a nice range. I listened to a variety of music with it, though my favorite testing track is Sam Robson's \\""I Need Thee Every Hour\\"" from his YouTube channel (look him up!). It sounded beautiful through the speaker, and the volume was able to get plenty loud. The on-device volume setting is independent of your phone/tablet/etc's bluetooth volume setting, so make sure you haven't turned one of the two down by accident if you find the speaker won't get loud. While I couldn't find information on what version of Bluetooth this speaker uses, I suspect it's Bluetooth 4.0 as I didn't notice any discernible lag between the video on my Galaxy Note 4 and the audio coming out of the speaker.<br /><br />I really like how the speaker uses different status tones for things like Power On, Bluetooth Paired, and Max Volume. A lot of other speakers use spoken words instead of tones, and usually they just come out sounding like very poorly pronounced or broken English, and it gives the speaker a cheap feel. My only gripe with the status tones is the Power On tone ... it is ALWAYS loud no matter where you have the volume set when you turned the speaker off, and it often startles me. Overall, though, it's not a deal-breaker by any means.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with this speakers sound, looks, and especially its slightly tilted design and status-light ring; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a portable single-driver Bluetooth speaker based off its performance. It's aesthetics are just icing on the cake.<br /><br />Review disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product for the purposes of examination and review. No review or particular rating was promised in return, and the opinions expressed here are my own following my first-hand experiences with this product.oken English, and it gives the speaker a cheap feel.

The vendor's address is only 70 miles from me. Prime is so cool why deal with 10 day shipping. The item looks cheesy but it turns out it works very nicely. It's hard to remove the GPS from the cradle until you figure it out but just pull the tab down and a little bump on the GPS with the palm of your hand and all is well.  My GPS stayed put on my MTB ride very securely. Just a tip from an old MX guy; when installing the cradle leave a little exposed pigtail of each wire tie so you can grasp it with a pair of pliers to tighten them, wire  ties tend to expand a little in the heat and from bouncing around.

B00EF3SQAO,"DEH-X6600BT - Pioneer In-Dash CD/MP3/WMA Car Stereo Receiver with Bluetooth, iPhone/iPod USB Support, Android Media Access, and Pandora Ready",Mobile_Electronics,4,"Installed this myself, wasn't too difficult after getting the Metra housing and wiring harness.  The only issue I have had is the unit recognizing my Android.  I cannot get it to work via USB, and it kept shutting off when I connected through Bluetooth.  After almost giving up and using an AUX cable for months, I finally found a random forum that said to turn off Auto-sync for your apps when you are connected via Bluetooth.  So basically you don't get new emails or other updates to your phone until you reactivate it, but you're driving anyway so do you really need it?  Its a frustrating fact but at least now I can make phone calls and not drop them suddenly.  Also, the microphone works great, suggest you mount it above your A pillar."

B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,This Sentey Bluetooth Speaker B-trek S8 is definitely a nice little speaker with very good sound quality especially the bass! I was able to easily connect the speaker to my phone as well as my tablet. The buttons on this speaker do have a tiny lag to them but that doesn't bother me because it's not a long lag at all. I also like that the buttons are marked clearly and bigger then most speakers I've seen so if you don't have the best vision you would definitely be able to see what each button is for. The speaker doesn't get overly loud but it does fill a room nicely. I also really like that this speaker comes with a carrying case so you can easily take it with you when traveling or to just keep it from getting dirty. I would definitely recommend this Sentey Bluetooth Speaker B-trek S8!<br /><br />**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**

I did a decent bit of research before purchasing it - nothing negative to be said. Though, again, there wasn't much of an overly positive response either. It must be just one of those things, neither terrible nor exceptional. It just exists, I guess.<br /><br />But, yeah, for me, what I require of it, it's been good. A simple, budget build with the desire for a slightly overclocked CPU (Intel G3258). No complaints.<br /><br />edit: though, for the price, at least at the time of this edit (Around $62.50 + shipping, 8/31/15), I'd go with something else. You could probably get a much better board. Still, no complaints."

Great sound for the price range, long battery life, no connection issues. It does have a couple of weird quirks; first you have to hold down the volume buttons or it skips songs (it should be the other way around). Second, if you plug an aux into the speaker before plugging in your device it won't recognize it so you have to unplug and replug the cord back into the speaker."

My mistake getting 1 foot long. You have no idea how short 1 foot is for a cable until you use it. For example, unless the electrical source is in front of or below the device, you cannot have it facing you, it will be facing away. If you want a useful but manageable length, get 3 feet. Also, the Lightening side is a bit thicker than the OEM, so if you have a case with a small opening for the Lightening port, it may be difficult to attach."

Heed the advice on the SD card comments though, or it will not work.  I did the research before and bought two class 4 16Gb cards for the two units I purchased.  The only thing I would like to see on them is somehow to quickly &#34;lock&#34; a file when there is an &#34;event&#34; that you want to keep.  We had to pop the card out and copy the file(s) to a PC so they wouldn't get erased.  There is a way to do it on the camera, but it's not so easy."

The hot glue they used to hold it together had failed, and the screw through the &#34;antenna&#34; was not actually making contact with the antenna. Very poorly put together. After I removed the antenna from the feed coax, I actually picked up as many stations on the coax as I did with the antenna attached. My guess, the antenna's poor connection kept it from working.<br /><br />Pick another antenna."

B00KW3XNUE,Magicfly Wireless RF Item Locator Key Finder 1 RF Transmitter and 6 Receivers,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I bought this as a &#34;filler&#34; gift for my sister and tried it out before I gave it to her.<br /><br />The reduction of 1 star is because this requres aaa batteries which are not included in the purchase (main reason I opened it before giving it as a gift) and I hate it when a product that requires batteries does not include them in the packaging. Almost everyone does now and have a little separator to ensure they dont discharge while it is on the shelf. This did not.<br /><br />However, as far as its use, its really useful. Comes with little rings so you can set one on each set of keys you have and it also has little stickers so you can attach it to something that does not have a keyring area. Works great within the house to find your keys and the remote has a little stand so you can leave on your coffee table but also take with you when you are on the hunt for your misplaced keys.<br /><br />Im thinking of getting one for myself now."

When the screen of the device goes off, the keyboard will go to sleep about .5-1.5 minutes afterward, which can make taking notes in a medium speed class a little annoying.<br />The case is padded, so it feel like my device is safe. I haven't really been annoyed by the tan trip hanging out under the keyboard, but I can see how it would be annoying.<br />Sometimes the keyboard slides out of place when closing and will prevent the case from closing, which is really just an annoyance rather than serious issue.<br />The range for the bluetooth keyboard is actually pretty decent, so you can pull it out of the case and type remotely (say, in a class where you're not allowed to have electronics and you're trying to hide it from the teacher)<br />Battery seems a little iffy, and I wish there was a better way to determine how much you have left. But it charges easily from the standard mini-USB."

B008RQCCF0,"Mivizu Shell 10.1"" Sleeve Case for iPad Air, 4 3 2, Samsung Tab, Touch Screens",Mobile_Electronics,4,"I ordered this based on other reviews indicating it was spacious compared to their iPad Air. I have an armored rubber case on my iPad Air 1 (wifi model), after a short drop out of a Logitech keyboard shattered my previous device.  I still use the keyboard, but require a small folding easel to prop up the screen.<br /><br />Bottom line, the iPad w/armored case has enough room, but the rubberized texture makes for slow loading and unloading. Once that's all the way into this case, I can carefully slide the keyboard in also, but it's not any where close to &#34;roomy&#34;.<br /><br />As to the 4 stars, I'm not yet sold on the quality of this case. The plastic zipper tabs feel like they won't last, and the zipper itself has me being very careful.  I like how widely it opens, and the useful outside pouch, which holds my Mifi and dust cloth, but not the easel :(<br /><br />Overall I think this is a solid value for the price, especially if you are using a slim cover/lid for your iPad."

B00MFM89XQ,"Lumsing&reg; Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with NFC Built-in Microphone, Powerful Sound Rechargeable Battery up to 1 Day Playtime",Mobile_Electronics,5,"This little guy isn't going to set the world on fire with big bass or amazing fidelity, but for the $10 I paid, I can't imagine getting any more than this guy gives.  Easy to pair via NFC, love that it has an actual power switch, great build quality, good enough sound (physics prevents it's tiny size from sounding bigger or fuller).  I do wish it could go just a couple notches louder, though I imagine it would probably distort.  And a weird con that could be limited to my speaker - it sounded worse (softer, scratchier, almost mono) directly connected with a cable than with bluetooth.  Usually a direct connection is better.  Go figure.  Great value."
B00LTZF7RG,Garmin Forerunner 620 GPS Watch with HRM-Run - Blue & Black,Mobile_Electronics,4,I like this better than my previous agar in in that it is not as effected by moisture as the first one the 220.

It was quirky in that getting it to pair through Bluetooth was inconsistent. It often required some extra time to get it to work but it always did. Until about a month ago. Now, it won't pair with Bluetooth at all. I contacted Xtrememac to ask about a warranty and they sent me a form response saying to take it to the store I bought it from for repairs. If you are willing to just always plug it in then the speakers themselves are nice. Good sound quality. But I bought it for the Bluetooth and that no longer works."

It paired with my phone on the first try, which was great, as I still have been unable to get the other one we own to pair with my phone. I wasn't expecting a lot since it is a small little speaker, but to my pleasant surprise, it has really great sound quality. The bass is good with a rich quality to it and the overall sound is very good. The volume is also pretty decent and carries well. I could hear it fine in the next room. It did &#34;skip&#34; a bit occasionally when it was on a different surface level than my phone, say a foot or two lower and a couple feet away, so it's a tad finicky about placement, but that just requires a bit of adjustment. Once it's in a good spot, it plays well and the sound quality is better than I anticipated. I am very happy with this little speaker and it will get a ton of use at our house. I'm putting it on my nightstand tonight so I can listen to my relaxation app through a speaker instead of just my tiny phone speaker.

At this time, there is noting we can do about making the end pieces smaller due to the size of the wire being used. People who have certain cases like Otterbox and Lifeproof may have to take their case off to use the cable. Our 3ft cable has end pieces that are the standard size.&#34;<br /><br />Yeah, okay, I'm going to take off my case every time I want to charge just so I can use your POS wire. Every other lightning cable I have, both Apple and not, work fine with the case, so these folks are clearly doing something wrong. As demonstrated above, I e-mailed them before reviewing to give them a chance to fix the situation with these useless cables, and they basically told me to get lost.

B00CJZLHN8,"Apple Ipod Nano 7th Generation, 16GB, Silver",Mobile_Electronics,3,"As many other reviewers have pointed out, the main seller of these iPod Nanos on Amazon is advertising new (&#34;non-retail package&#34;) units but is actually shipping old, refurbished units with expired warranties. I would recommend spending those few extra $s and buying an iPod Nano from Apple. That being said, my three-star review is directed firmly at Apple and the 7th gen Nano itself...<br /><br />Firstly, this is truly (as Jony Ive would no doubt tell you) a wonderful, magical device and a miracle of modern engineering. The 7th gen's internal amp is a slight step up from that of the 6th gen Nano with a cleaner sound and marginally quieter noise floor, although I still prefer the size (and clip) of the 6th gen model. Here's why the 7th gen Nano only gets three stars from me. For a dedicated DAP that does basically nothing but play music and has no internet-connection capabilities of any kind, 16 Gb storage is pathetic and paltry. (Technically, it can play video too, but with the tiny screen and tiny amount of storage, I'm not sure why Apple even bothered with this capability.) After waiting three years for a refresh of this product, what do we get? Improved internals? More storage? At least the OPTION to pay lots of extra $$$$s for more storage? Nope. We get new colors. That's right -the opportunity to buy the exact same thing, but in a slightly different color.  Come on Apple. Get your act together."

B00AI5UOJ4,OontZ Angle Bluetooth Speaker [FIRST GENERATION] Ultra Portable Wireless with Built in Mic up to 10 Hour Playtime works with iPhone iPad tablet Samsung and smart phones - Green Grille,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Great product for the price. I bought this a few years ago for $39.99 with prime. Now it is even lower. I may pick up another. It pairs seamlessly and when compared to my sister's small jawbone it blew it away. I now have a BEM as well. While the BEM is more portable it does not have the sound quality or power of the Oomtz. I recommend keeping the supplying music device's volume at about 75% or lower and use the speaker to control the volume. It packs a punch and there is very little distortion even at high volume. It's not the smallest unit out there but I think the better bass and more crisp sound is aided by the shape and size of this unit. The battery has good life even when using it to fill my whole family room with sound. Also, the speaker phone comes in handy while using the unit. If you are looking for a high value good sounding option that you can take anywhere I recommend it."
B00OZGI5T8,VGC VR-6600PRO-A 50 Watts Dual Band Mobile Ham Radio （This Item Not Include BTG-6600A1）,Mobile_Electronics,4,"First impressions:<br /><br />This is not a radio for new users to start with.  I may be spoilt from simple mono banders and the simple & basic programming the Baofengs with CHIRP, but programming the VR-6600Pro manually is a chore.<br /><br />But once you have it programmed it is easy to use and a powerful rig.  I would just not recommend it to a novice user who is just starting out in radio.  Once I had the radio programmed it was a piece of cake for my daughter to operate the radio, but difficult for me to remember the steps to make changes.  I would find myself having to scroll through bands via the [B] key a lot if wanted to toggle from VHF to UHF and back to VHF, because there is no backwards with the [B]. One Press to go from VHF to 220Mhz, another press to skip the 300Mhz band , then 6 more presses to go back to VHF, as you have toggle through the extra bands.  Even when you disable the wide RX coverage, you still have Line In, AM and FM bands to toggle through.  I have sent a feature request into VGC to see about getting Line In, AM and FM moved into the expanded section.  I would like to just have 144, 220 & 440 on my mobile rig!<br /><br />While not a lab grade test, Amelia and I were able to have a QSO in simplex VHF from our house to a ham in Tracy 39 miles away as the crow flies with 50 watts.  All our on air reports have been favorable, nothing out of the ordinary either pro or con.  So no objections to on air performance at all.<br /><br /> My theories on the overall feature set and radio operation are the following:<br /><br />* VeroTelecom is a land mobile radio company where features, adjustability and flexibility are king.  The radios will be programmed by a technician, who has time to study and configure the radio for a semi static operation.  The average business will not reprogram frequencies often and will mostly just use the memory function.  This leads to a lot of advance features, but less focus on simpler operations, programing ease and the User Interface/Experience.<br /><br />* VeroTelecom is innovating with the APRS features, but again, it is deep in the feature set and not a novice grade set up.<br /><br />* When I sent in a feature request that would make manual programming easier for hams, the factory politely vetoed my suggestion to retain maximum flexibility.  I think this is due to the land mobile vision.<br /><br />APRS Setup<br /><br />I have the APRS module ready to set up, I downloaded APRSdroid for my Android phone, I sent off and got a passcode, but have not had time to set up APRS on the radio. I will get the APRS function set up as soon as I mount the radio.<br /><br /> Quick Reference<br /><br />There are a couple short cuts and quick references I will be setting up for the radio.  Little things that can make a hams life easier.  Keep an eye out on the VR6600 Facebook page."

Most radar detectors go off continuously when driving through cities or small towns. Usually we disconnect it because it becomes so annoying. This particular one only goes off when there is cop. It gives plenty of notice and has saved us from getting several speeding tickets. We travel quite often and have found that it works in all of the southern states. It is a little pricey but is certainly worth every penny.

B0067XVNTG,"Generic Car Dashboard Video Camera Vehicle Video Accident Recorder (2.0"" 1080P)",Mobile_Electronics,5,"This is a decent little dash-cam if you want to try out the concept for little outlay. You will need the reviews on Amazon because documentation is somewhere between minimal and nonexistent.<br />A couple of comments:<br />There are buttons that I have no idea what they do. One I accidentally pushed caused a lock icon to appear briefly, so I have to assume that it locks that file for later viewing. I have no idea which button that is nor was I able to replicate the behavior.<br />When you’re changing the language note that you cannot get into the menu if the device is plugged in. The menu only appears when powered by battery. You hit “menu” twice because the first push takes you to settings and the second push moves you to the menu tab with language options. Other reviews diagram what to look for in the default Russian for changing the language.<br />If you use a zip-tie to connect it to your rear view mirror you then don't have to worry about it coming disconnected on hot days. Carefully place so that it does not prevent you putting your mirror in night mode.<br />If the device keeps shutting itself off it likely has one of two problems:<br />If the light is red, it's losing power and the battery is not sufficient to run it without available power. Check your power cord and reseat it until the red light goes out and turns pink or blue (pink = charging, blue=charged).<br />If the light is not red but it repeatedly shuts off, take out the MicroSD card and format it on your computer. Although it overwrites old data, deleted files may still be enough to make the device think there is no storage available. Once you format it’ll work again.<br />As noted in other reviews, a class-4 MicroSD of no more than 16 GB is required. You can use a larger card, but it will not overwrite.<br />The camera is not locked into position, it moves around a bit, but if your cord is not pulling on it, it will generally hang flat.<br />The cord is extra long so that you can run it under the fascia down your A pillar and over to your power/cigarette lighter outlet. Note that it is not long enough if your power is not on the dash. Mine is in the hatch under my elbow and it's about 12 inches too short to go along the front window, down the A pillar, under the dash, and then back to the hatch where my power ports reside.<br />Generally a decent starter camera. If it dies I will probably buy a more expensive one with support and documentation, but so far so good.<br />I'm giving it 5 stars because, for the money, it's a good device. If you want a higher end dash-cam then you'll have to pay for one.der the fascia down your A pillar and over to your power/cigarette lighter outlet. Note that it is not long enough if your power is not on the dash. Mine is in the hatch under my elbow and it's about 12 inches too short to go along the front window, down the A pillar, under the dash, and then back to the hatch where my power ports reside.<br />Generally a decent starter camera. If it dies I will probably buy a more expensive one with support and documentation, but so far so good.<br />I'm giving it 5 stars because, for the money, it's a good device. If you want a higher end dash-cam then you'll have to pay for one."
B00ZJAAM72,"Best Apple Watch Charging Stand for 38mm and 42mm from ZIVACHI, Highest Quality, Lightweight and Portable, for Home and Office, Non Slip Surface and Bottom. Protection from Scratching. (Black)",Mobile_Electronics,5,This is a nice charging watch stand for the Apple watch.  I was surprised on how compact it was when I received it.  The stand has a nice weight to it and isn't light cheap plastic.  There is also a rubber pad that grips the watch nicely in place then you seat the watch on the charging pad of the stand.  The lower opening is sized right to allow the watch band to hang freely with out much extra so it's not resting on the lower part of the stand.  Overall I think this is a nice solid product for the price.

B0105XU088,AUSDOM AD170 Car DVR Dashboard Camcorder + G-Sensor + 2.0 Inch HD LCD TFT Display + 110° Viewing Angle Automobile Dashboard Camera Records in 1080p Full HD (Iron Gray),Mobile_Electronics,3,"[[VIDEOID:1ae21e9bbe62e359707f17eb50db85d0]] 🎬 Video Review 🎬<br /><br />✏️ Plus Bonus Top 5 Beau Thoughts:<br /><br />1⃣ Easy install. Took less than 4 minutes.<br />2⃣ Requires a micro SD card. I used this one: [[ASIN:B00M55C0NS SanDisk Ultra 32GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDHC Memory Card With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-032G-G4A [Old Version]]]. It works perfectly.<br />3⃣ Reason for the 3 stars: when attempting to press the menu button, it takes quite a while to activate. (we're talking a frustrating long time...) There are simply other dash cams out there in the same price range that work.<br />4⃣ Delay shut-off time.  I like this feature, and it shows up here and there in other dash cams as well. This features allows the camera to continue recording for 30-ish seconds after you shut off the power (your car).  Smart idea since accidents can still happen if your is at a stand-still with the ignition off.<br />5⃣ Video files: It records to AVI files that play natively on a Mac. This is nice because other dash cams I've tested record to a weird codec (still AVI video though) and have to be converted prior to playing.  If you can't play the video files, use VLC Player (free download).<br /><br />If you're curious every 60 seconds of footage uses about 200mbs of memory.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don't work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product's performance.<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />- No, not really. There are other more reliable options out there in the same price range."

B00GQYWMFU,SunroadTek® CCD Sony chip Car Back Up Rear View Reverse Reversing Parking Camera for Ford Transit-Connect 2010-2015,Mobile_Electronics,4,"Camera works very well. Good video quality and the unit fits very well into the place of the old license plate light location. However there is one silly problem that makes no sense to me. The wire included with it is not long enough to reach the front of the van. Now I understand universal units not having enough wire but when I buy something made for a specific model, I do expect the wire to have been properly measured out for the vehicle (part of the custom fit). I figure it needed to be about 6 feet longer, so expect to extend the wire using an RCA barrel connector unless you tape it to the ceiling."

For a moment I got worried that the protector wouldn't work because it seemed awfully thin, and my iPod is white. I applied it and it works out wonderfully. The mirror is very clear so you can see, even on the edges, and when you use your device it's not blurred or distorted. If you look from an angle when your device is ON you might have very very mild green or pinkish streaks, but nothing so serious it hinders any use of the mirror or iPod. Plus, with the pack of 6 and cheap price, I even used one on my android phone. Yeah, sure, people look at me like I'm nuts but for me it really works."

B008E8JJ16,Mighty Dwarf 26W Vibration Speaker - Black,Mobile_Electronics,1,"There are three vibration speakers: ones that have a broader base and a narrow or regular top [[ASIN:B00JZT6JZ2 CableWholesale Bluetooth 4.0 Portable Vibration Induction Sound Speaker for Smart Phone/Tablets/MP3 Players (5002-40100)]]; ones that have the same base and top (a cylinder shape) and come with a built-in FM receiver; and then there is this a little bit longer cylinder job.  The first two get power from a USB cord and the last is an AC plug in.  The first is good, but lacks the remote control and FM radio.  Its virtue is it is 26 watts and a little more powerful than the second.  It is also a blue tooth device.  The second's virtues are a good price with lots of functionality (not a blue tooth though).  The last is the worst of the three.  It buzzes, has a volume control on the AC cord together with its on/off switch, is not blue tooth, has no radio, and, although it might be a little more powerful than the second, it distorts badly when pushed.  All in all the second is the best, unless you want a blue tooth device."

B00U7Q6VAA,"DITOP® 7"" TFT LCD Color 2 Video Input Car RearView Headrest Monitor DVD VCR Monitor With Remote and Stand & Support Rotating The Screen",Mobile_Electronics,5,"My wife recently purchased a NAV/DVD player for Father's Day.  It was a Pioneer AVH-X5700BHS for my 2010 Ford F150.  I wanted to be able to play videos for my kids on long trips but have a NAV and backup camera.  I didn't want to spend a large amount on headrest monitors nor did I want to install a over head DVD console.<br /><br />I came across the DITOP TFT LCD monitors by mistake for $19.99 each and decided to give them a try.<br /><br />When they arrived I was quite impressed by them.  The came with a bracket plate that you can use to cut and install in your headrest yourselves and there is also a bracket included that will allow you to install it on flat surfaces.<br /><br />I did not want to cut my headrests out just in case they were to be bad.  I also didn't want to mount them to a flat surface.  Then I remembered I purchased some headrest mounts for our iPad/Android tablets because I didn't want to buy a DVD player.  After looking at the headrest brackets that came with the DITOP LCD monitors and the tablet mounts I decided to modify the tablet mount to receive the DITOP LCD bracket.<br /><br />I removed the bracket plate and ran the wiring down the opening around my headrest posts to one central location under a seat.  The instructions for the LCD lack installation instructions.  They only go over the buttons on the screen and the remote.<br /><br />The wiring comes with a red/fused line, blue, and black.  I believe that the red line is constant and the blue is switched.  The black was obviously ground.  I ended up putting the red/blue together and connecting them to a 12v plug that I could manually plug in and out because they are constantly on in standby.<br /><br />After about an hour install of running lines and carefully placing them inside and under the seats I was finally able to test them.<br /><br />I was amazed of the quality they showed.  I think these would make a great addition to any vehicle.  I recommend them.  I included installation pictures.es."

Ascetically it is a beautiful little speaker. That is the only good ting I have to say. My first impression sonically is &#34;you're kidding me right?&#34; It sounds like a cheap 1960's transistor radio. So, it thought, i'll give it the benefit of the doubt and move it to a larger space. That is when this product really showed it colors. I took it about 15 feet.... that's all, and all it did was sputter and go in and out. I was running this off a newer iMac which has pretty amazing bluetooth capabilities.<br />So long story short; if you want something to run off your phone or tablet and are planning to be in the same room as the device, then this may be the speaker for you. If you have low expectations sonically, then this may be the speaker for you. If you want a speaker that is cool looking, this is absolutely the speaker for you."

The device easily slides inside (or out) when the phubby is on my wrist because of the tab at the top. Put it on with the tab on the inside of your wrist closest to your hand and it's a cinch to slide your ipod in our out, the earbud leads snake out of the corner with no problem.  It's very comfortable and not at all warm or annoying.  I ordered a small....I'm very small boned."

B00X5WRB5W,Garmin Forerunner 110 GPS Unisex Sports Fitness Watch Black 010-00863-00,Mobile_Electronics,5,"i have had this watch for about 3 months now. i have never owned any other type of gps enable watch before this one. however, my father owns the forerunner 305 and my mother has the forerunner 405 so i do still have some experience with those watches as well. in my opinion this is the best watch of the group hands down. the watch literally feels like a standard stopwatch. no extra weight, no extra bulk. the 405 does not quite fit like a normal watch due to the antenna extending down into the wrist strap. this watch is extremely comfortable to wear at all times and very adjustable in size (the holes go around the entire strap). this watch is very basic for runners and thus lacks the extra bells and whistles that the 305 and 405 have such as &#34;ghost&#34; trainers and &#34;breadcrumb&#34; directions. however this watch gives you current pace (more in just a moment), distance, calories, time, heart rate, and chimes at each &#34;lap.&#34; for a standard running regimen this watch is more than enough to supplement a good, hard workout.<br /><br />CURRENT PACE EXPLANATION<br />-i have noticed a lot of confusion about the idea of this watch lacking current &#34;real-time&#34; pace. However, to be quite honest, &#34;real time&#34; pace on a gps watch is pretty useless. the gps in the watch is NOT hooked up to a satellite CONTINUOUSLY. no gps in the world has this capability. instead, each gps has a certain &#34;ping&#34; time to send and receive a signal from a satellite. more advanced gps systems have quicker &#34;pings&#34; to more closely mimic a continuous connection but the connection is still never actually continuous. on watches that advertise &#34;current pace,&#34; the watch is simply showing you the exact speed at which you were going between the last two pings. basically the watch calculates the distance traveled between each ping and then uses the time it took you to go that distance to get a speed. this leaves a lot of room for random spikes and troughs in the data. no human can run at a single speed across a certain distance. the human body simply cannot set itself to &#34;cruise&#34; and go from there. thus a &#34;real time&#34; pace is fairly useless for a runner. let me give an example. if someone were to turn on their forerunner 405 and set it to show current pace and run for 20 seconds at an 8:00min/mi pace, assuming the watch has a ping every 2 seconds or so, the data would look something like this: 6:52, 7:20, 8:15,7:47, 8:30, 6:59, 8:02, 8:10, etc...obviously this data is not really constant with an 8:00min/mi pace however the person may still very well be able to hit EXACTLY an 8:00min mile. What the forerunner 110 does, rather than show the data from EACH ping, is it takes each ping and adds it to a list with every other ping that has been recorded across the time frame and averages them all together. the final number that is shown on your watch will thus be called the &#34;current AVERAGE pace.&#34; which in all honesty is MUCH more useful if one is trying to hit a certain pace goal. basically this current average pace can quite accurately depict your mile split well before you've reached the mile marker..if you speed up significantly then the ping data will thus be in a lower range and bring your &#34;average&#34; time down. now some of you might think that this means that the watch only displays a pace that doesnt refresh very often. however, the exact opposite is true. the watch will refresh the current average pace every time another ping comes in..so basically your current average pace could hypothetically move up or down with every single ping. but due to the beauty of the AVERAGE, the watch will not jump around sporadically like in a &#34;current pace&#34; but rather stay around a certain time and gradually move up or down according to your speed. in essence, the &#34;current pace&#34; on a lot of gps watches is really truly useless and most people will never end up using it because it doesnt actuallygive you any solid data to work off of. because the data is changing so dramatically each second, the data is just plain useless. FYI: some runners may have noticed very random spikes in their &#34;fastest&#34; pace that the garmin software will show after uploading the data. basically, &#34;fastest pace&#34; during your run means that for one single ping during the run you might have run a 5:34min/mile pace for all of 1 second. however, because that pace is still part of the data that is added into the overall time, it still counts as your &#34;fastest pace&#34; for the run even though your average mile pace for the workout was only 8:34...<br /><br />another nice thing about this watch is that after each run is saved to the history on the watch, it can be accessed to show the average pace over the entire distance rather than just the mile splits. the mile splits for older runs can only be accessed and viewed once the watch is connected to a computer and the data is uploaded.<br /><br />hope all of this has cleared up any confusion about current average pace for the forerunner 110!"

This product set's  up is very simple and easy. Clip camera to windshield mount, plug in the power cable which has a micro USB that goes to the camera and standard USB on the supply side.

The suction cup mounting is extremely strong and I have no concern that it will fall off, even in extreme weather. The angles in the description are accurate, and it picks up a clear image in that range. There is no infrared, so what you get at night on dark roads is only what your headlights illuminate.

B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"Was instantly impressed when I synced this to my phone and first started playing some tunes. It's loud, clear, and there's a decent amount of bass. However, don't be expecting anything room shattering; it's got just enough 'thump' to have a balanced sound.<br /><br />Really, though, the quality of sound this thing puts out is just impressive. I sat it side by side with my 130$ Creative Sound Blaster AXX 200, and it was going toe to toe. I honestly think, at the end of the day, the Sentey sounds better. It just has a 'fuller' sound to me. The Creative arguably has clearer highs and mids, but the Sentey's got it beat in bass. And overall, it just sounds less 'tinny' than the Creative.<br /><br />GREAT bang for your buck at its current price. This speaker sounds like it should at least cost 50 or 60$. It's a great buy for a budget bluetooth speaker.<br /><br />I've been investigating Sentey more and more lately after seeing how many products they have on Amazon and all the great reviews they've been getting. Apparently they are a US founded company, which is awesome. However, when perusing their website, I see a lot of grammatical and spelling errors common in foreign hired help. Whether they outsource their media building or not, that is somewhat concerning coming from a company claiming to reside in Florida. Who knows... maybe they are a bunch of American orientals?? Lol<br /><br />Still, the quality of this speaker is on par for what you pay. It's solid. Feels durable. It's quite hefty in the hand, and has a nice rubber finish for a good grip on the outside. The buttons are large and easy to see and are touch sensitive.<br /><br />Overall... a great buy! This thing puts out more sound than it should!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it for it's current price (33$)."

B00ZNRTBY6,"AmorTek 7” - 12” Device Universal Car Tablet Headrest Mount with 360 Degree Adjustable Rotating Travel Kit for iPhone6 Plus,iPad Air 2, iPad Air, iPad Mini (1, 2, 3), iPad 2/ 3/ 4,Samsung Galaxy",Mobile_Electronics,5,"When we travel, the kids like to use their electronics, so I ordered this to hold up the tablets. I find it to have a strong mounting, with endless adjustments, and to be suitable for a wide range of tablets.<br /><br />FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a coupon that covered the cost of this product, so that I could review it. I did order it from Amazon.<br /><br />The device clips onto one side of the headrest pole (as seen on the product page). The designers have done an excellent job in making this a \\""universal\\"" mount. I found that based on my measurements, it will fit any tablet with a height of 5.5 inches up to 8 inches. This would be measured at the narrowest part of the tablet. The arms that hold the tablet have a spring control to hold snugly and yet release easily as well, while the main section extends and then locks into place. There are rubberized pads on top and bottom. The device has knobs for all places that tighten, so it is really easy to mount and adjust. I was worried when I saw the design that it might not hold the tablet well, but in fact it does fine. At first, the poles at the top went over the power button on my Android tablet, but even the top feet can be moved, so it worked out. I am impressed by the ingenuity that went into this unit - well done!<br /><br />There are a couple of things to consider when ordering. You must have bare support poles for this to work, and the poles need to be straight, not curved. So if you are a short person, this would not work on your seat because the headrest would be snug against the seat. Mine had a small bend on both sides, but there was still enough straight pole for the mount to work. Also, the headrest needs to be at least 2 inches above the seat back. In my case, the head rest was just barely high enough above the seat so that the tightening knob would still work. Do the measurements before you order to make sure your car will work: straight support poles, with the head rest at least 2 inches above the seat.<br /><br />Summary: A great mount for your tablet to keep the kids occupied - but check your specific car first. Highly recommended..<br /><br />Summary: A great mount for your tablet to keep the kids occupied - but check your specific car first. Highly recommended."

Connects very easy, the power seems to last for a pretty long time. I ran it for at least 12+ hours and the light started flashing at me which I believe meant it needs to charge soon.

B00ZJAAM72,"Best Apple Watch Charging Stand for 38mm and 42mm from ZIVACHI, Highest Quality, Lightweight and Portable, for Home and Office, Non Slip Surface and Bottom. Protection from Scratching. (Black)",Mobile_Electronics,4,I just received this and I must say its just what I was looking for. I had purchased a different type before buying this one but I didn't realize the other style was for the sports bands that lay flat. I have the melanise loop which will not lay flat. This raised option is perfect. There is only one con I've found with this product and that is that they added an indent for the cord to go but it will not stay because of the length of the connecting piece to the battery charger. For me that's not a deal breaker. But for those who must have the cord tucked away you may need to pull out a drill and angle the hole differently at the top to make it work or find some decorative tape to embellish and hide it. It's a handsome and sleek. I anticipated it to look cheap but I was pleasantly surprised. It also has a decent weight where it won't move or turn over easily.

Let me say that first of all that it's not the sellers fault, it's the suppliers fault that is giving misleading and / or incorrect information to the sellers.  I've seen these advertised both ways, with a 4X digital power Zoom and without it.  Let me correct this first conflicting issue, the GT300 model does not have any type of digital zoom.<br />Also the battery is sealed up and not changable, the problem is that on a fully charged battery, I couldn't get more than twelve minutes of straight video recording which is pretty low and constantly needs recharging.<br />I would just spend more money and buy something that's better and has AMAZON PRIME just in case you do get a lemmon.<br />Good luck."

B00KW3XNUE,Magicfly Wireless RF Item Locator Key Finder 1 RF Transmitter and 6 Receivers,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Pros:  Great for &#34;those of us&#34; that misplace things. Well actually, &#34;we&#34; don't misplace things, it's some &#34;unknown force/gremlin&#34; that moves them someplace else from were &#34;we&#34; put them. :)  Nice loud sound from the receivers and the flashing led is easy to see in dim light.  The flashlight on the transmitter is neat and provides a pretty good beam.  Receivers are nicely constructed and have thick support around the ring hole, was able to use a larger ring than the tiny ones supplied.  Broadcast distance was very/very good.  Tested by letting wife hide a receiver.  I started downstairs, other side of house, with receiver &#34;hidden&#34; in a desk drawer upstairs on the far side of the house. Approx. distance 20 meters through maybe 3 interior walls. I could not hear the 'beep' but my wife said 'it' beeped.  In wandering around until I finally heard it.  Didn't take too much to finally narrow a possible room location.  My ears might not give an exact location of where the sound came from but I knew it had to in there somewhere. Just simply started opening drawers and pressing the button.  Found it!!  Total time: about 5-6 minutes whereas I've spent what seemed like hours retracing steps and tearing apart the house looking. Cons: If receiver is laying totally flat, colour up, the sound is muffled because the speaker is on the back.  Wish there was a 'replacement face' or overlay for the transmitter to write down what each colour ID was assigned to.  Heck, if I can't remember where something is at,  HOW DO THEY EXPECT ME to remember what each colour represents???  Is that expecting too much from me? ;) ;)  [I know, I know - tape a cheat sheet on the back of the transmitter.] Problem not encountered yet:  How do I find the transmitter if that darn &#34;unknown force/gremlin&#34; hides it on me?  Buy another set?  ;)"

B00R1303QK,Aweek® 360 Degree Car Radar Detector Anti Radar Detector with LED Display Car Alarm Vehicle Speed Control Radar Detect Russian /English Voice,Mobile_Electronics,4,"This is a nice value priced radar detector. No this isn't going to perform as well as a $450 dollar unit and shouldn't be expected to.<br />But this seems to do the job well enough.<br /><br />I recently used this on work trip, and for the first time in my life, i wanted to see a cop and despite the 150 miles one way trip THERE WAS 1 COP total there and back. lol. This did give me a warning, however, as with all radar detectors, the issue is, for me at least, i like to have my music, relatively loud,and therefor cannot hear any sort of radar detector. The normal solution to this is the light up display, however when i am on unfamiliar roads with people who apparently got their license back when they were just giving them away.... (Yea im talking about most of the people that drive the 495 beltway) The last thing i would do would be to look down frequently to check the radar detector.<br /><br />So in my 300 mile testing, i found that highway mode worked reasonably well, with the occasion &#34;false&#34; alarm. I say false in quotations because i fully believe it picked up some signal from the k band, it just wasn't a warning i cared about. Many programmable road signs, will send an alert for instance.<br /><br />Best i can tell this detects h,x,k,KA,Str La bands. What any of them are i have no clue though the road signs that triggered alerts were all on the K band.<br /><br />However in city mode i surprised that this did not go bananas as they used to when close to a stores theft detection tag sensors at the door.<br /><br />The unit comes with a clear gel grip pad to help hold the unit in place, a car adapter that features an on and off button, instructions in both russian and english, and of course the radar detector.<br /><br />It is nice and low profile so it wasnt so blatantly obvious it was there despite sitting in the middle of my dash. The unit features a nice small display that shows what band it is detecting as well as the signal strength to help you gauge distance.  and 3 touch buttons, 2 for volume up and down, and 1 to cycle between city modes and highway mode. ( i assume the different modes help to skip some false warnings.<br /><br />The speaking, if i caught it correctly said&#34; position ahead&#34; in an accented but clear English voice. By the point it had gone off i had decided music was more important, as i rarely excessively speed anyways (10 mph over on highway)<br /><br />I have only 3 slight reasons it loses a star. While it is at a great price, it is missing the detector-detector featured on the similar cost cobra unit, and the barrel power connector is almost 2x the length it needs to be, causing the silver barrel to stick out even when properly seated, messing up such a sleek appearance.  And lastly, the manual. I think that this manual is more of a generic manual that is sent with a few different models, and while not overly complicated to operate the manual almost makes it more confusing. I am fairly confident that the russian language manual is more detailed showing which bands are supported and what looks like what those bands would be.<br /><br />Still  dollar amount considered, i give this 4 stars.<br /><br />This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review. MY ratings never remotely consider that factor, I rely to much on reviews from time to time when buying products to give something a positive rating because its free. However I  do consider the list price on amazon for some items to keep it all in context.

U-turns not much fun in 40' rv towing 20' car. I had high hopes but not looking promising for cross-USA mapping"

B00QG4VU76,"Eonon GA5151 *Android* (04-09) Mazda3 - 7"" LCD Touch Screen DVD / GPS Navigation",Mobile_Electronics,3,"After some confusion (no documentation), I got my GA5151 installed in my 2004 Mazda 3. I have used it now for about 3 weeks. I love having the functionality of an Android tablet in my head unit. I use my phone as a mobile hotspot so I can use Maps, Waze, Pandora, etc. UPDATE: the Wi-Fi functionality often does not work and for 5-10 minutes after start. Screen Mirroring DOES NOT WORK, and since this is the most advertised function, I was tempted to send it back (to China). I have tried connecting a Note 4, S3, Galaxy Tab, and Kindle Fire with no success. :( If I do get it to work I will update this. I am able to use my steering buttons. The functionality of the radio application is not user friendly and it sounds horrible for all but the strongest signal stations, but I don't use the radio much anyway. The boot up time is about 1-2 minutes and reconnecting the Wi-Fi connection each trip can be even slower. If I want to listen to Pandora on a 5 minute trip to the store, I will spend most of the route in silence trying to get it to start :( There is no included documentation. There is a pdf installed in the unit, but it is difficult to understand and of little use. I assume the advertised functionality of dimming the display when headlights are on would work if it were wired properly, but how to do so is not apparent. I have not figured out how to connect the old LCD that sits on top or if that would work. The USB flash drive is not limited to 16GB, I connected a 128 GB thumb drive with no problem. :) I have not found the advertised option of changing the 86 opening logo splash screen nor changing between 9 LED button lighting colors :(  Overall, I still like the functions that the stock radio doesn't have, but I am disappointed in the advertised functions that don't work.  Installation tips: 1) loosen the side brackets on the HU to allow the holes of the LCD module on top to align to the holes in the side brackets. 2) if the bottom of the unit does not sit flush intothe environmental control module below, you may have to (carefully) remove the while clips from your old unit to use in the GA5151."

It fit perfectly on my Garmin but after about 3 mins placed on the left corner of the windshield it fell off. The inner rubber seal (on the small circular component inside) was cracked and the suction cup could not hold the weight or lock. The rubber suction part came off and I could see that the seal was broke. Unfortunately for me I threw out the packaging and have not returned it.. I guess for a $5 part maybe it's expected.  I didn't think it would break the same day I got it.

The only issue I had was that it was hard to press the button to retract my key at first. As I used it more and more its now easy to retract.

B00W3FYFDI,E-PRANCE EP503 FULL HD 23041296P Car Camera Recorder 170 Degree Wide Angle Lens WDR Night Version G-Sensor HDMI,Mobile_Electronics,4,"A nice little dash cam with solid features. The software that came with the camera is awful. It would only play the video upside down. After reading comments on a similar camera, I found that a program called &#34;Registrator Viewer&#34; (registratorviewer dot com) works perfectly with this camera. It's free, but I did make a donation because I liked it so much. It allows you to see all the data this little camera makes available and excellent features allow you to quickly find and export the specific clip you're looking for. This camera also has a microphone built in, but you need to enable it in the settings. The audio quality really isn't that good, but it's better than nothing. It sounds like it's underwater. The video quality is quite good. I also like that it has a built-in battery, so it can continue recording for a little while (configurable), even after you shut off the engine. The unit itself is also much smaller than I thought is was going to be. Overall, a great little dash cam for the price. I may even get one for the rear window."
B00W345QOG,Andoer Wireless Bluetooth Digital Transmitter Digital Sound Audio Decoding Optical Coaxial 3.5mm audio Transmission Sound for Television Blu-ray DVD Smart Phones Computers,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I found this item under several brand names here on Amazon. It was the only reasonable BT transmitter with digital/Toslink input which I needed to convert a TV's output to a BT signal (the TV, a Toshiba, does not have analog audio output, as odd as that seems). When I first tried to buy this item (the Andoer), Amazon said the soonest it would arrive was after I was to leave for the weekend (where the device was to be installed as part of a gift), for whatever reasons 2 day or 1 day prime shipping wasn't available.<br /><br />So I bought the seemingly identical item branded as &#34;LingsFire&#34; (at $5 more) because 2 day shipping was an option for that item. That unit arrived in 2 days (a day before leaving for the weekend), but the power supply didn't work (it put out 1.7V instead of the required 5V) and the device/box itself never powered-on even when used with a verified good power supply. So I started the return/refund process for that product (which perhaps coincidentally, appeared to have been previously opened and re-sealed/taped).<br /><br />I then searched again on Amazon and now free 1-day shipping was available for the Andoer-branded version of this device! So I purchased it and crossed my fingers. It arrived at 6pm the following day and we made the boat for our weekend trip where the device was to be installed along with a JBL Flip 2 speaker for my hard-of-hearing father to watch/hear the television without bothering everyone else in the house.<br /><br />I tested the new (Andoer) power-supply (it put out 5v) and device/unit quickly (the blue LED came on and blinked) and then packed it up along with the BT speaker for our trip.<br /><br />PAIRING:<br />I read the directions for both devices, but could not get them to pair. I sat and stared and read and re-read and tried different BT speakers. Finally, I decided to hold down the power button for like 10 seconds and finally the LED flashed quickly alternating between red and blue. *This* is the pairing mode. The slow blue blinking LED is *not* pairing mode. Anyway, once I discovered this, it was smooth-sailing and everyone is very happy.<br /><br />I do wish there was less lag/latency however: there's really no way, at least with this TV, to eliminate the delay between the audio coming out of the TV's built-in speakers and those coming from the BT speaker. So we just disable or turn-down the TV's speakers, but that may not be an option for everyone.de. The slow blue blinking LED is *not* pairing mode.

Although it has a touchscreen, it had buttons too, which helped me avoid accidentally triggering unwanted touchscreen gestures. It supported organizing files into folders, like on the computer. It supported djvus, which I hdn't been able to open on my previous e-reader, and supported a wider range of pdfs. It didn't support all the accessibility options than Android KitKat devices are supposed to support, like disabling unwanted touchscreen gestures.  After 26 days, it stopped working. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bugs with their support website. I can't get a clear answer, and I can't file a rma request while the website's broken, but I think they want me to ship this to Eindhoven for repairs, and pay them to ship it back. That's more than $70 right there. This is less than one month old, and this is still under warranty. I still hope I can get this repaired, either under warranty or otherwise.  P.S. I got the website working, I should be able to get this repaired.  P.P.S. I got the authorization, all the information to send it in for repairs, mailed it, and due to yet another mix-up, they didn't accept it so it is being returned undelivered. *headdesk*"
B00QERR5CY,iXCC Multi pack Lightning cable,Mobile_Electronics,5,I ordered this with Amazon Prime and it came within the time that it said it would.

B00MIG3P2Y,Precision Power Black Ice Car Amplifier - 650 W RMS - 1300 W PMPO - 1 Channel - Class D BA1300.1D,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Randy L. With 1 star.  Great feedback, the detailed explanation of the product was wonderful.  NOT!!!!  Here is the deal.  I actually own this product, tested it at rated capacity, voltage/Current drops, distortion and linearity.  Great results.  Not the best, but great.  Very useful hi/lo pass filters.  The only issue I have is the mounting fasteners are cross thread screws, duh.  Hex  head would have been choice design.  I play loud music, 130 dB at 15 to  20 volts for every road trip, to from work,  110 F summer....No heat on this amp at all.  For those clowns who try and increase their wattage by lowering the load resistance, we'll you deserve blown components and you definitely should not hobby stereo until you take some engineering courses on electrical theory.  YOUR AMP CAN ONLY PRODUCE A FINITE AMOUNT OF POWER, dropping your resistance is why your amps melt with no power gained.<br /><br />."

Within a few minutes it was mounted, all the settings I wanted set up, and ready to use.  The power cord that it comes with is more than long enough for anyone to make it work the way they need to.  The suction cup mount is pretty awesome.  I've never had one that sticks as well as this one does.  The picture quality is fantastic, much better than I expected for a device in this price range.<br /><br />I'm not sure why they went with mini USB instead of micro USB.  It means I have to have a separate charger, specifically for this device, since everything else uses micro USB.  Overall this is just a minor annoyance.  The camera does not automatically start recording unless you press the OK button to begin, which is not good in the event you forget to start it and actually needed it.<br /><br />The main reason I'm returning the dash cam is due to the internal battery.  It is completely useless to the point that I believe the unit I received has to be defective.  After being plugged in over an hour, the moment the device loses connection to power it instantly shuts off.  If it's manually turned back on, it shows &#34;low battery&#34; and shuts off within 15 seconds."

It is around ten seconds until test stops for results to be displayed. You can just stop blowing into the device or take a short breath and continue for 3-4 more seconds. This is just my experience.<br /><br />I have teenagers and I never had to use it to get the truth out of them since this a mental deterrent. Well, has a couple of years until 21, the others are over the legal age to consume. I use it more for driving suspicions.

They last reasonably long but if the strap catches on something it can snap, and the connection point wears out in time.  The Loop is very flat and elegantly designed, and its maybe the only feature the iPod touch has that the iPhone doesn't, perhaps because they're frequently used as a stand-in for a point-and-shoot camera.  But I can see why Apple discontinued the loop attachment on the new 6th-generation iPod touch - they break just a bit too easily.  Still I recommend having one - it makes it much easier not to drop it accidentally."

It's perfect for our bathroom, backyard carport/shade structure, garage, kitchen, etc. I bought it to take with me on a long upcoming road trip (old tapedeck stereo in the car due to be replaced), and I know it'll be perfect. It syncs smoothly within a few seconds with my iPhone or the hubby's Android, and only begins to cut out once you move your phone away from the unit more than 15 feet or so.

It connected with my iPhone 6 Plus almost immediately which was really nice. As soon as I started playing a song I realized it lit up to the beat of the music. That was really neat! I stared at it for a minute and forgot what I was about to do for a second. I love that I can use this speaker while cleaning around the house. I can grab this and my phone and move from one room to the next easily. The speaker is very compact and lightweight and doesn't take up any space at all so I can put it on a shelf, dresser, or counter somewhere while I clean. The sound quality is actually really impressive for the size. There is no distortion and you can actually hear the bass coming from the song. You can also answer phone calls and use the speaker as a hands free speaker. The sound on the other end of a phone call is nice and clear as well. I had no problems hearing someone on the other end and they had no problems hearing me. I also like the fact that I can connect devices through an AUX cable or put a USB flash drive in the speaker to play music. It even has a built in antenna and radio! So far, I really like this little speaker. It's pretty awesome and quite impressive given its size. *discount received for testing and review*"
B00MFM89XQ,"Lumsing&reg; Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with NFC Built-in Microphone, Powerful Sound Rechargeable Battery up to 1 Day Playtime",Mobile_Electronics,2,"It does what it's supposed to but the sound quality is bad.  I was hoping to use this for our basement when we're playing with the kids.  I've found the sound to be much more clear at the same volume levels simply using my HTC One's speakers.  Sure, they are great speakers for a phone but I figured this could at least equal the clarity at higher volume levels. I was wrong. I would save your money."
B00KS278NW,XYUN TM Apple iPod Touch 5 Generation Case,Mobile_Electronics,2,I bought this for my daughter's Birthday. She's 11 but isn't excessively hard on the stuff she owns. Within one day of owning this case the paint had begun to wear off. The green on the front of the case also doesn't match the photo. It has a dingy look to it. Think less aqua and more seaweed. I've attached photos to my review to give you an idea of what I'm describing.

It is a bit thicker and obviously doesn’t feel as high quality as Apple’s, but all I want this for is to exercise with and do yardwork – it doesn’t need to cost $300!<br /><br />The instructions that came with this are in Chinese, so don’t expect to have instructions to look at. You can download some file management software to transfer files (like iTunes) or you can basically just drag and drop files. I tried the software with it and it worked fine. I didn’t mess with videos or photos – I just want to listen to music. The internal 8GB of space is PLENTY room for my music. I won’t ever listen to this longer than 2 or 3 hours at a time, so I am perfectly fine with managing my files manually rather than having a 64GB SD card.

So I will share it with you........ The power cord has 3 wires, (black) ground – (yellow) B+ and (Red) ACC. Then there is the other wire that is to connect the rear camera “a plug type of connection”.  The easiest way to connect the power in thru the fuse box.  The red and yellow wires are connected to 2 - 15amp fuses (1 on each wire) the yellow (B+) goes to a constant power supply. My Hazard lights use a 15amp fuse and it always has power whether or not the car is turned on, so I replaced the fuse already inserted in the cars fuse box with the fuse on the yellow wire. And the Red (ACC) needs a power source that shut off when the key is removed, so… my cigarette lighter will not work when the car is turned off and it uses a 15amp fuse, so I replaced the fuse already inserted in the cars fuse box with the fuse on the red wire. And the black (ground) connects to the metal frame…..anywhere is fine, but not connect to the fuse box………….just in case you come into contact with live wires. I haven’t tried to hook up the rear camera but I’m assuming that the red wire on the rear camera is to be hooked up to your back-up light, not sure didn’t do any research on it. The reason I didn’t give the product 5 stars is because I had to search the web to find out where the wires go, other than that…………..I love it, it works great…….once I got the power installed. :-)"

Purchased unit was not able to record cassette tape to USB as a MP3 file. USB stick was formatted to FAT32. Included directions followed. Neither box nor directions had company name, address or telephone. No warranty. Ended up with a FM only transistor radio. Unit not worth the time to try to get to work or use. Unit thrown away as junk. Purchased a much better unit from www.boyton.com model HFL-17WEC which completed recording a 1994 cassette tape to MP3 recording on a USB stick the first time tried. Recording had a hiss which was in the tape during playback. Used free PC software Audacity to do a noise filter which resulted in an almost CD quality recording. HFL-17WEC also records from LP records (33, 45, 78) and audio line in to MP3.

If you were to find the absolute cheapest DVD player it likely would not lock up like this unit does...and this is not just a bad unit, our replacement does the exact same thing.<br /><br />One night while camping, the alarm went of, it would do this intermittently even though the alarm wasn't set.  This time the power button would not work so we were unable to shut it off so I literally beat this thing to death to shut it off.  The next morning I got a screw driver and removed this thing from out trailer and threw it in the trash.

G sensor too sensitive for NYC roads eventhough i have set it to lowest setting.<br />3. The dashcam lens has chrome rim which didnt make it a stealth. It attracts thieves instead."

I highly recommend, in fact I expect to extend the life use of this pouch, when the scent is no longer viable, I'll add essential oils on the pouch and shake it up again then rehang."

However, my reviews are always my own opinion and not influenced in any way.<br /><br />I bought this case for my husband who works long night shift hours. I was sick of his battery always getting low or dying during his shift! When the product arrived we were both shocked, how stylish the case was but also impressed with the quality of the product!  As other reviewers have stated the case is a little bulky but my husband actually prefers that so that wasn’t an issue. He has used the case for a week now and each morning he gets home his phone is at 90-95%!  This is a big improvement from 0-20% without the case. Now everyone he works with is interested in buying this case from just seeing his results! I will add that you cannot charge the case with your phone’s lighting cable; you must use the USB cable that is included with the case. So that is the only con that I have but it’s not a big deal! I highly recommend all iphone users to get this case and enjoy your phone during the day without having to worry about your battery life!"

B008R68DFS,Patazon Black Extension Dock Extender 30pin Adapter for iPod iPhone 4 4S,Mobile_Electronics,3,"It fits in a Lifeproof case with the door bent slightly open.  But it came with the plastic shell not on square and not fully glued together.  I have been using it for a few months and it has held up, but I am being very careful with it.  If I had to order this again I would go with a cable version.  Primarily because the phone is not stable when it sits an inch above the dock in my Bose which was designed to cradle it and give it support across the bottom.  That is a very shakey situation....it would be better to just set the phone flat on the counter beside the unit and be able to hold it in your hand when operating the screen."

It stays connected and charges my iPhones, and iPads (Mini, Air). The longer cord is great so I can charge and use I bed, whereas the shorter cord required me to lay on my side if I used it while charging. One caveat is that it does not fit my wife's Lifeproof iPhone 6 case. It works with my iPhone 5S Lifeproof case but not hers. Therefore, I gave the second charger to my daughter for her iPhone 6 Plus that is not protected by Lifeproof."

B0057EUVAI,Lowrance Mark-5X Pro Fishfinder Mono 83/200 kHz,Mobile_Electronics,1,I did my research and decided this unit was the best for the price range. I go fishing in Canada once a year and plan all year for the next trip.  Imagine my surprise when an hour into the use it starts reading 1.3 feet in the middle of the lake.  To get it working again I have to perform multiple reboots.  Ten minutes later it's reading 1.3 again. I end up losing my deep water crank bait while trying to get the unit working again.  Fortunately my fishing partner brought his 4 year old hummingbird.  It worked like a champ all week. After researching the unit symptoms I find lowrance is known to have quality issues with their transducers.  Would not recommend this unit to anyone. Now I get to research warranty claims for a unit that I will never trust.

B0026520A0,Refurbished Creative ZEN Vision:M Mp3 Player 30GB (Black),Mobile_Electronics,4,"I'm writing this review after several years of use. This ZEN was purchased after my original took an unfortunate two feet drop straight onto concrete while it was playing and died an instant, hopefully painless death. I attempted to repair the device afterward by purchasing and installing a new hard disc. Unfortunately this never ended up solving the problem, so after that 40 dollars thrown away I decided to purchase a refurbished model online.<br /><br />It came packaged in a smaller version of something like the original ZEN packaging. If you're like me, you could immediately tell it was refurbished because it had been super-glued shut somehow. I tried my damnedest to open up the case to try my hard disc in it, still trying to troubleshoot the old one and see if I had purchased a faulty disc or if it was some other issue with my original. No doing - it remained glued shut and I didn't want to press my luck, so I left it.<br /><br />Has all the design limitations and benefits as the original. Same wonderful weight in your hand, same easily manipulated interface, same software limitations (when I buy a new mp3, it's going to be able to play FLAC files). It's always had an average to good sound quality for what it is, and a massive amount of storage for everyone with massive music collections. This refurbished model seems to have a shorter battery life than my original, but not enough to complain about. Overall it's a fair purchase, and I expect it'll last me another several years before I replace it with some super new non-Apple product."

B00B4992M8,"Belkin Shield Sheer Matte f/iPod Nano 7th gen. - Transparent, F8W222VFC00 (7th gen. - Transparent)",Mobile_Electronics,3,"Kind of ambivalent about this one. Belkin makes good stuff, and have been happy with other items in their line. There's really nothing to this, and part of the problem is the design of the iPod. Was hoping for a design that would shield the entire thing,including the glass touch screen,  but they aren't out there.  This is like a picture frame without anything to shield the art from the elements. Wanted to do this without getting a bulky water-resist product, and keep dirt out  of ports, etc. . This snaps on quickly, is not slippery, and does afford some degree of protection, mainly against scratches on the back. It's expensive for what one gets, though, and it's usefulness is yet to be determined. More later, if any opinion changes."

The amp is 2400 hifonics Zeus and it pushes these beast to the limit they haven't distorted on any regular songs just on bass boosted songs with the bass knob turned up so they can handle alot of power but make sure you get the correct box mine a little small so it takes about some of the range on the frequencies but other than that great subs

B00LGJT3EI,SODIAL(R) 550 Survival Bracelet with Stainless Steel Bow Shackle - Olive Drab Green,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I like it well enough. The cord is tightly woven so no need to worry about that. The clasp works well, I've had it on over a week straight and snagged it a few times without breaking it.  I would buy a couple more for the price. I am very surprised to write the first review, actually. I've had others from local stores and this is much better than the buckle up kind. I couldn't tell you or not if this is &#34;real&#34; 550 cord, but as far as I could tell it is. It's really a great buy, especially for the price. I could see spending up to 5-8 dollars on this instead of 2."

B011QV22OS,"Bluetooth Stand Portable Speaker Lithium Battery, 2*3w Output Power",Mobile_Electronics,5,"I am TOTALLY impressed with this BlueTooth speaker. Honestly, you'd almost think it was a mini stereo system. The sound quality is amazing. The bass is even pretty great for the size of the speaker.

B00MFM89XQ,"Lumsing&reg; Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with NFC Built-in Microphone, Powerful Sound Rechargeable Battery up to 1 Day Playtime",Mobile_Electronics,5,"Very easy to connect, pretty good sound quality and it has 24 hour playback! Not just stand-by.  I also own a JBL bluetooth speaker and didn't want to take that on a 2-day hike, although it has great sound quality it couldn't compete with the battery life of the Lumsing.  Also at $15 bucks I wouldn't have felt bad if I lost this in the woods or it got damaged.<br /><br />Cons<br />The UI could use some work.  If you press the + icon it goes to the next song but if you hold it, it will raise the volume.  Kind of odd to combine the 'volume' and 'next' functions.  The on-board system sounds are a bit too loud and annoying as well."
B00CFXDD5Y,Remote Fix Flip Key FOB keyless entry transmitter case buttons pad and panic for Volkswagen VW by First Midwest,Mobile_Electronics,4,"Looks good.  As one review stated the new panic button doesn't sit flush.  However my other key fob, which has years of wear on it, is higher in the middle and flush on the ends.  The original panic button could have been worn flush over the years.<br /><br />The reason for four stars instead of five is there were no instructions with the parts.  A link to an on-line video would be helpful."

The amp keeps getting too hot and going  into protect mode but I don't have it in a very ventilated area so that's probably my bad.  The sub itself hits pretty hard and sound clean in my jeep wrangler. So far it's worth the money.

So if you want to mount our GPS to an air vent this will probably work fine. My only concern is how the A/C now and Heat during winter will affect the GPS. In order to have a good view, i had to mount it on the air vent in the middle over my radio. Those air vents cannot be turned off so hopefully it will not make my GPS crap out. Had for about a month now and no issues yet."

My son was able to easily connect it to his iPhone and listen to tunes in the shower. However, after using this for a few months, sometimes the speaker doesn't work even when it's been charged fully. Now 6 months later, we can't even get it to work again. This is frustrating and disappointing."

B00VU7PKZW,"iXCC Element Series 1ft Micro USB to USB 2.0 Cable, A Male to Micro B Charge and Sync Cable For Android/Samsung/Windows/MP3/Camera and other Device",Mobile_Electronics,5,"I absolutely love these super short cables. They are perfect for using with a power bank (iXCC offers many kinds--check them out) or for using them with an action cam such as the SJ4000 (which I personally use them for). It is a basic microusb cable, theres nothing special about it other then it being super short! I have used this cable for a few weeks now and during that period it has endured numerous bends, pulls, drops, and baby slobber! The cable works just perfect. I appreciate iXCC not overdoing it with branding. While there is some branding they when with branding that blends in well. I applaud them for that.<br /><br />Speed wise its rated for up to 480mbps, pretty much the standard for usb cables so you will get your standard results.<br /><br />The quality is there like all other iXCC products. I was a bit worried about my 9 month olds slobber when she got ahold of it. I have had cables in the past either A) stop working or B) start messing up and then later corrode. She had this thing almost entirely in her mouth for a good 5 minutes (yes I know, bad parent.. I was busying looking on Amazon!) and once I pulled it out I just wiped it down with a baby wipe and let it dry.<br /><br />I would recommend this cable if you use power banks and your device accepts microUSB or if you own a goPro or action camera. No reason to have those 3 foot cables when you are using your device right next to a battery or computer.<br /><br />Discount provided for review."
B009WQQYG2,MP3 Player,Mobile_Electronics,2,"After spending a few weeks trying to make do with this product, I returned it.  The documentation was confusing.  (For example, it took me a long time to figure out that actually the podcasts were under &#34;books.&#34;)  Also, the battery did not hold its charge well.  I spent an additional $25 to get a Sony MP3 player and consider the money well spent."

Body is tough. The GMRS specifically tuned antenna works excellent in flat and hilly terrain and with trees and buildings. These radios are tough. I have accidentally dropped these from my bicycle at 12-17 mph, watching them skip on the asphalt for 30-40 yards, and nothing broke. Voice inversion scramble works neat for disguising communications. Easy to program using the Chirp software. Look it up."

This may fit the older model Dragonfly, but not the new versions. I believe the 4 series uses the same mount as the 5 series, so it may not fit. I had to creat an adaptor plate to accommodate the different diameter 5 series base and this smaller size mount. It works great with the plate. This rating would be a 5 star if it would fit the 5 series without a custom made plate. Product itself is great and works with no other problems"

Also it was described to me as a 4 channel amp which it is not it is only 2 channel. Biggest waste of money. Tried getting a hold of buyer and never heard back. This is false advertising.

This speaker can also play really loud for its' size without losing quality.<br /><br />The connection strength is also quite good. I can easily go 30 feet in the line of sight without a problem. With items and walls blocking the connection you can't go quite as far but still a good distance.<br /><br />There is an on/off, play/pause/bluetooth, volume up, volume down buttons.One of the coolest features is that you can use this speaker with so many devices wether they are bluetooth or not. You can plug your phone or computer in using an auxiliary cord or you can even play music or files off of a micros card! This is awesome because you can load your music on to a card and this is one of the best portable speakers on the market for its' size!<br /><br />I haven't tried the microphone yet but I will update when I do. Charging is done using a micros cord (same as most android phones use).<br /><br />Overall this is an amazing portable speaker or stand alone music player if you add a micro-sd card. For the current sale price this item is a steal! Even for the regular listing price this item is easily worth it! I highly recommend!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."

I did get hung up in Windows and needed to reference the owners' manual, but all things considered, a great value.

Decided to purchase a dual garage laser assist and am very disappointed.  I've had to move it three times because the sensor does not pick up the movement of the vehicles.  It has to be placed virtually directly above one of the vehicles which defeats the purpose of the &#34;dual&#34; aspect.  What's the point if you can't place it in the center of your garage?  The motion sensor is only activated once you get within about 3-4 feet from it.  Purchase two single park assists rather than the dual.

B00QMMBXA6,"Tomtom VIA 1515M Automobile Portable GPS Navigator - Black, Gray",Mobile_Electronics,2,"This is my third GPS, the other two being Garmin's. The first the connector broke and the second I returned to Amazon because it could not be recogized as being plugged into my computer - the later I will explain ( please read).  Just returned from trip 7/21/15. On the way out I thought it did a better job of street names, etc than that garmins. Programing it for trips is pretty easy as well. I will say if you do not have the actual STREET address you have issues because its programed for STATE, CITY, STREET, ADDRESS. I did realize just today that you can go to POI and it list hotels and then you can just type in the hotel name for the city so that's cool. Easier to do on the Garmin's.  Pros: easy to program, Cheap, life time maps whatever that means.  Cons: this is the big negative for me. Street names. What good does it do to tell me the name when I'm in the turn? This past trip I missed a lot of turns because it did not announce the street name in advance. My Garmin's had a large box at the top of the screen showing the name of the street. This has a small box on the right that one has to seriously take there eyes off the road to read and for those two reasons I would not purchase this. The third reason was the graphic display. I spent a lifetime designing training materials and working in Powerpoint to create slides and I couldn't have chosen worse colors then they came up with. If you can see the cross streets your eyes are better than mine. Horrible washed out background.   Note: It did announce in advance major highways like ' turn left ahead on US 2 but not streets in towns. To be honest we just got smart phones and played with the GPS in our town and its no comparison to either the Garmin or Tom Tom. Need to find a bracket to hang it on then I'm done with both Garmin and Tom Tom.  Last: Both of my Garmins and my new Tom Tom were not recognized by computer as being plugged in thus, you cannot update maps or charge the darn thing. Found out how to get aroundit. You know this is a big issue when both companies have a page of instructions to try. My guess, MS doesn't like these new products and so there is a compatibility issue here.  1. Go into My Computer 2. Go into Devices 3. Find Tom Tom or your device name 4. Click on the Windows box and select 'activate or whatever the word is. This should now start the communication process. If I had to guess I would think its another Windows change to prevent you from running hardware by just plugging it in."

Which is a pain.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.  I bought an AGPTEK 8 GB MP3 player with mini SD card capability, and with a 32 GB card, it works fine, but you have to buy an AGPTEK card, for compatibility concerns and currently a 64 MB card is not offered, hence my reason for purchasing this non-mighty Thor 64 GB.

It's a very modern little thing, available in several vivid colors.  It puts out very good sound for a speaker its size, but does sound a little bit high in treble.  Pairing up the speaker with my phone was a breeze.  I just hit play on my media player, jumped into the shower,  and the band played on.  Picking up a call that came in was as easy as pushing a button.  Explaining why I was taking a call in the shower, well, NOT so easy.<br />  I did run into a bit of a small problem with this speaker.  While the suction cup is VERY strong, it would let go randomly.  It happened rarely, and was a great way to practice my reflexes while waking up in the morning.

It would increase the life of the suction cup, and be less frustrating for those of us with no fingernails.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount, allowing me to honestly review it for you."

Since it's small and portable, I am just beginning to find other way to use it.  Best 20 bucks I ever spent!"

B00Y2100OO,LiteXim All in One Large Touch Screen Hands Free Digital Mp3/Mp4 Music Player Music/Audio/FM radio & Micro SD Card (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"[[VIDEOID:1a66cffb6a753403712db268f47a596e]] For many out there, name brand means way to much. Why do we spend so much on a device just to play music and look cool (or so we think looks cool). I am not one of these people. I value a good deal and good quality that is affordable. That is why I love the LiteXim mp3/mp4 player.<br />I was looking for something to listen to my audio books/files while in the car and running. This little device is PERFECT for what I need. Great Strong clip on the back allows me to clip it to my belt/shirt sleeve and start running getting lost in the music. It is easy to use with simple button feature. it comes with simple to read instructions, but playing around on it for a few minutes and I could use it with ease. It plays music files, video files, pictures, records and plays back recording, FM radio and even can save text type files.<br />For the price, your not going to beat this great little device. Well worth the price."

It seemed to function exactly as advertised. However after several uses, when recharging it, the red light never turns off. I have used several chargers; the results are the same. I do not know if it is failing to accept a full charge or if perhaps there is a flaw in  the circuitry which prevents the charging light to turn off. Visiting their website offered no support for this model, but they responded quickly to an e-mail and sent a replacement which performs perfectly and will accept a charge from any charger in my arsenal. Works best with the supplied cable."

I use the horn only and use different drivers in small monitors. The only drawback is do not use a heavy driver with these horns because they can break just ahead of the threaded part. The plastic is thin at that point. If you use a small neo or lighter weight driver then you're fine.

The controls the call,play,pause, stuff like that feel like very strong plastic I am impressed with them. Also it seem very user friendly because I was able to figure it out with out using the setup guide. Now for the good part<br /><br />[volume/bass]<br />I am beyond blown away at how nice this speaker sounds. It's good in the mids and highs and when you have a song with mad bass this speaker will do that song justice. This speaker is over a amazing speaker when it comes to sound. You will not go wrong with the sound!<br /><br />[Bluetooth]<br />It took about 30 seconds for my iPhone6 to connect with the arespark I was very surprised. I also turned off the speaker and turned off my phones Bluetooth then turned them both on and the arespark automatically connected that's a nice feature! I have not had any issues with the signal dropping its been vary rely able<br /><br />[phone/calls]<br />I have only used this feature for a test call to see if it works and it passed. The only problem I have found so far is the microphone and were its places makes it hard to talk in to.<br /><br />[Other stuff]<br />It comes with a sd card slot for all you android peeps<br />Also on the iPhone in the status bar were your Bluetooth icon is it shows a battery for the arespark not sure about android.<br /><br />[final thoughts]<br />This is a amazing product.

B00Z8D8VM8,"Thor 64 GB Slim 1.8"" LCD Mp3 Mp4 Player Media/Music/Audio Player with accessories(Purple Color)",Mobile_Electronics,3,I will start with the cons. The headphones did not work out of the box. I was not going to use them anyway but most people would be upset about that. The ipod coppied spinwheel is just for decorations you must click buttons to do anything. The instructions would be useless because there is so little to them and much is needed because despite having only 5 buttons navigating is confusing until you get the hang of it. However the instructions on the inside are just wrong. You might as well throw it away because it will be easier to figure out on your own. It will take time to figure all the options out too. Some buttons i cant even tell if they work or when they work. Navigating the different folders (bands/singers) is annoying and a crapshoot to find out if songs will replay over and over. I have found that starting from the beginning works well but if you want to skip a song you have to click the skip button for each song.<br />the pros...a 64gb mp3 player for under $30. The sound is average and the equalizer helps but if you are looking for premium sound this isnt it.<br />the setup to put music on from my wmp was quick and easy. I am not sure if i got an exclusive deal but for the money i paid and for what i use it for (at work where it can potentially break easily) it was a steal. If i compare it to the ipod that it is trying to copy then it is garbage.<br />my advice is if you dont mind figuring out menus then this is for you. If you want to play the music you want when you want and easily navigatethe menus then this is not for you. If you have to pay retail price there are better options.

As other people have noted with devices like this, if you connect this to a device that is being powered/charged by USB, it causes a buzzing sound that's keyed to your engines RPMs but this is easily solved by adding a ground loop isolator between this device and your phone/other device. I connect this device to a small Bluetooth receiver that's powered by USB to give myself Bluetooth connectivity (and to hide the wires) and this setup works flawlessly. Sound quality is good and volume is as loud or quiet as I want it to get (even with the ground loop isolator which makes things quieter)."
B00PIG6IZC,"BESTEK Waterproof Ultra-Portable Bluetooth Speaker Shower Speaker with Built-in MIC , Support Micro SD/TF Card &NFC&FM Radio ,10 hours Playtime, High-Def Sound for Outdoor/Indoor Use (Yellow)",Mobile_Electronics,1,The speaker wouldn't charge so I never actually got to use it. Tried two different usb cables and used a 5V 1 amp charge as specified. Looking back through the 5 star reviews I can't help but think they were all paid reviewers since they all seem to review 3+ products a day.<br /><br />The speaker doesn't appear to actually be &#34;Waterproof&#34; but it is probably splashproof. The instruction manual makes it seem like the USB cable somehow doubles as an antenna for FM radio which doesn't make much sense to me and would further degrade the water resistance since the side panel would have to be left open.

About a month and a half later, after my return window expired, the ipod started acting crazy. Songs skipping all over the place for no reason and some computer voice breaking into the song over and over telling me the name of the song and what folder it came out of. I cannot get it to stop.

B00YW7Y6K2,"SoundLogic XT BCCS-6/6395 Portable Rechargeable Wireless Bluetooth Rave Dance Party Speaker with LED Light Show and Built in Microphone, for iPhone, iPad, Samsung, Nexus, HTC and More",Mobile_Electronics,4,It's a pretty good bluetooth speaker. As long as you are using an actual music player and not just YouTube the sound and volume are pretty high quality. I liked that you could turn off the lights if you wanted to. The only reason I am giving four stars instead of 5 is because there are only two different lighting effects and the controls should really be flipped over (the speaker would need to be upside down in order for the controls to be written right side up). Overall though it is a quality product and I would recommend it.
B00WSDFA6Q,"32GB Green Slim 1.8"" 4th LCD Mp3 Mp4 Player FM Radio Video Player with Accessories",Mobile_Electronics,1,"The user interface is horrible.

Lanzar's a strong company, I like the VCT-4110, you can turn it up without much distortion...The 2000w can handle your stock or upgraded speakers, but I plan on buying another Lanzar amp when I get around to installing 3 (10&#34;) subs...For a new 2000W 4ch amp under $100, you can't go wrong.

B00BJ9ZLGO,Skar Audio SK-125.4D Class D 4 Channel Amplifier,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Surprisingly good amp.  Don't be scared by the &#34;Class D&#34; label, this thing delivers very clean amplification, hits hard and fast, with lots of power to spare.  I'm driving 2.6ohm components and the amp barely gets warm while my ears are ringing... Very, very good power.  Just be sure your RCA preouts are properly grounded... lots of HUs these days have crappy RCA ground and that will give you alternator whine.  I fixed mine with a fused jumper between the RCA shield and the HU chassis, that solved the whine.  Even on a scope there is no more whine.<br /><br />You can bridge this amp to drive a pair of subs, it is rated for 2x 390w at 4 ohms, more than enough for most 10&#34; and 12&#34; subs, but really you should be running this on your fronts and rears because it is so clean sounding.  Get a proper mono amp for the subs and wire them to 2 or 1 ohm for more power :)"

B003ZFSJ3M,ASA E6B Metal Flight Computer,Mobile_Electronics,5,"This product definitely lives up to the long history of E6B flight computers. The aluminum is light, yet durable. The slide is a little long for my knee board, but I feel like that is the fault of the knee board designer. I can still fit it in there, but you need two free hands, which isn't always doable at 10,000 feet.<br /><br />This one comes with a simple bi-fold vinyl case. I threw my plotter and compass in there, and it really keeps everything contained in my flight bag.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good way to mark the clear course correction window, I had great luck with the wet-erase markers that they used on overhead projectors in school. You can easily get them at an office supply store. They are easy to see and they stay put. A quick swipe with a wet thumb cleans it off without issue. Dry-erase markers also work, but they brush off too easily."

The instructions say that the antenna is designed for vehicle trunk mount and I installed it as a base antenna with a 4 radial ground plane that may have been the problem with the swr. During tuning one of the allen screws edges wore down and will have to be retracted and replaced. This might have been because I wasn't careful enough when loosening and retightening it. I t works well on vhf 2 mtr and uhf 70 cm.

I recently decided to get a Spot 3 for kayaking. It is supposedly IPX7 rated (ie, should survive 30mn at up to 1m underwater). I took it out for a paddle this weekend put it in my life jacket's chest pocket. Battery compartment and USB were sealed and double checked. I spent about 10mn in the water with it during the day, swimming on the surface. At the end of the day, it wouldn't turn on. Opened the battery compartment to check and there were a few drops of water in there which I assume killed the device.  Called Spot today, and apparently water damage is not covered under the warranty. Kind of lame for a device that claims a waterproof rating."

I had to buy the second one as I lost the first one. I have always thought that a small aerial like the one supplied would not be very good. This aerial along with the set just captures signals especially the weaker ones that my Bearcats and Icoms don't pass the squelch level. I tried swapping the aerial to a bearcat 3500 but it didn't improve that. My AR108 is several years old but i use it in preference to more sophisticated radios due to its compact size but most of all performance.

B00XJJU4SC,Juentai JT-6188 Dual Band VHF/UHF 136-174/400-480MHz VHF 25Watt UHF 20Watts Dual Band Two Way Radios Mobile Transceiver Walkie Talkie,Mobile_Electronics,4,"These are pretty new to the market and I suspect that some of the odd firmware will be sorted out the same way it was in the Baofengs.  Don't let that stop you from buying one though.  There is nothing similar as far as size/weight/2m and 440 from ICOM, Kenwood or Yaesu.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot for the price but as it turns out I really like it.  For a small car this is the perfect size (a bit bigger than a radar detector).  Mine puts out 25 watts towards the top of the 2m band and ~23 or 24 at the bottom (my meter is just a cheapo with a swing needle so not super accurate but good enough).  The low power setting doesn't seem to work, other reviews and youtube videos confirm this.  It would be nice to have the feature to save battery power and generate less heat.  Speaking of heat, it does get warm but nothing crazy.  Short repeater chats kept the temp on the heat sink at about 125 degrees (measured with a non-contact thermometer), rag chewing on simplex with another guy for an hour or more and the temp got to 140.  I think if you were going to do a bunch of simplex it might be good to stick a small fan on the heat sink but honestly it'll get hotter inside my car parked in the sun.  The mic is solid feeling and a very good copy of a Kenwood mic right down to the silk screening on the boards.  The key layout is different though.  Modulation is a little low but not terrible.  Better than the Baofeng HTs at least.  I haven't seen a pin out diagram for this mic yet but I might try swapping in another mic.  EDIT: Its a Kenwood pinout.    Sound is good but not great (its a pretty small speaker) but it does get nice and loud without becoming very distorted.  I think this would make it a nice choice for use in a soft top Jeep or other noisy cabin vehicle.  Some low reviews here because of programming issues.  If you have fooled around with a Baofeng or any of the other china radios you should be ok.  If your experience is only with the big 3 japanese manufacturers or you've never programmed a radio before fret not, the Miklor site has a good step by step to do it manually (this is the same radio as the QYT 8900).  Of note even if you set the offset you'll still need to punch in the tx freq as well.  I wouldn't suggest trying to punch in a repeater while driving (which I can easily do on my other radios) but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to program all the local repeaters in there and be set.  It would not be my first choice for a long road trip for this reason.  I suspect that CHIRP will support it before too long (it is pretty new to the market after all). But even if they don't the factory software can be downloaded at the Miklor site.  Honestly if there was a Kewood or other big name radio with similar features/size/power output I would have bought that instead.  But I can't complain, the price is great and it works quite well.  I get great signal reports coupled with a 1/4 wave mag mount and the whole thing is easy to move around (rental car, truck driver etc etc).  73s"

When this happens, the little timer on the top right will read 00:00 with the record light flashing and it won't let you get into the menu. Only way to get it to work again is to unplug the power wire and let the battery die (takes 20 seconds anyway) bring it into the house, and manually delete the old movie files off of it in mass media mode. After doing this, the camera will work fine until it fills up again.

This unit is highly lacking in sensitivity.  Does not resolve HD2, HD3 reliably.  If you are on a HD2 and it loses the station, It reverts to HD1 without a prompt.<br /><br />I live near a major metropolitan area and should be able to resolve and hold HD2, HD3 with no problem.  This unit has all kinds of problems with HD FM.  Also the text prompts that are transmitted by the stations are sometimes scrambled and meaningless.<br /><br />I am an audiophile, and DO NOT recommend this unit.  Perhaps an antenna amplifier will help if I ever get around to installing one.<br /><br />On the positive side, the menus are very user friendly and operation of the unit is a breeze.  Can't speak about the performance of the power section because I use an outboard amplifier."

The problem is that after 9 months, with one use a week, one of the sides has gone dead.  Of course, with any earbuds, the wires are tiny and probably subject to breaking inside the insulation.  Or maybe they broke at the bud.  Dunno.  I will likely buy another pair but I wish these had lasted a while longer.  I thought I'd found the right thing."

B00OPEQ0KG,SanDisk Sansa Clip+ 4GB MP3 Player Black + MicroSD 8GB Memory Card (Bulk) Refurbished 12GB Total,Mobile_Electronics,2,"This little MP3 player was absolutely great before it stopped working. Light as a feather, clipped it on my collar and had my music wherever I went. Then it started mysteriously turning itself off. At first I thought it had just run out of batteries, so I went home and charged it. It worked fine again for another few days, then the problem suddenly got really bad. I would turn the player on and it would load up the home screen, but as soon as I pressed ANY button, it would shut off. I also tried not pressing anything just to see what would happen: it consistently turned itself off after about 20 seconds. I also tried resetting the device and updating the firmware; no improvement.<br /><br />I checked some online forums, and found out that apparently this is a problem with all of the Sansa Clips. It's only a small percentage that have this problem, but if you happen to get one of the bad ones, there's nothing you can do. Even worse, it shows up at random times: some people had their Clip for months before it started malfunctioning. So if yours is working reliably now, that doesn't mean it will keep working in the future. This is all based on what they're saying in the forums; I don't know if it's totally accurate. All I know is my Clip+ became completely unusable after two weeks.<br /><br />Very annoying, but at least the seller gave me a full and timely refund. They didn't even ask me to ship the product back -- which I guess makes sense, since it's pretty much a paperweight at this point.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk."

B00W138VS2,Original Autel Autolink Al619 Obdii CAN ABS and SRS Scan Tool Update Online,Mobile_Electronics,2,The unit is good. My only issue is the length of the OBDII cable. Three inches in length to connect under the dash of the vehicle. Very unrealistic. The picture shows a longer OBDII cord. The picture is deceiving. Recommend Amazon to remove this product from sales until vendor makes pictures a true representation of the product. Had to purchase a 5 foot extension cable to use it.. Requested a refund but vendor didn't understand the problem. Canceled refund  because I feel would be too difficult to resolve the issue. Will be more careful when purchasing items on Amazon. Amazon needs to resolve this.

B00U7XE03I,Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 2 [The PLUS Edition] Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with Built in Mic up to 15 Hour Playtime works with iPhone iPad tablet Samsung and smart phones (RED),Mobile_Electronics,5,"Warning: this review is based solely on first impressions after owning it for all of 20 minutes.  And the reaction of my 10 year old son: &#34;Wow!  You can really hear the bass.  Awesome!&#34;  Any gripes or problems and I will update this initial review.  I bought this primarily as a companion for our camping trips and other outings with friends (beach, park days, hikes around the county).  My son is increasingly interested in music and sharing it with friends is one way he is expanding his ability to participate in social gatherings and up his comfort level considerably.  The sound of this speaker compared to a smaller one we have owned for awhile is night and day, and for a not significant increase in expense.  Sometimes it pays to be a little behind the curve in tech but this speaker appears to be solidly built and a good solution for adding a soundtrack to outings in semi-remote areas or even around the house.  I'm hoping the bright color (red) will aid in keeping it handy and handling it carefully so it will last longer."

Used it for Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria.  The problem was that it had a hard time to find a location in another country when you were only 20 miles away. It still try's to ask you for state when there are none.  And what I really did not like is that you have to enter the house number first, then the street then the city.  Well that's kinda backwards especially when countries are so close together.  Let's try the country first, then the city then the street.  All I know is that it was not straight forward. You have to go to the upper right corner and do a &#34; search near&#34; to get closer into the country before you can proceed.   Having said all that, the maps themselves were very accurate and the directions, once finally in there, were spot on. It was really very helpful.  I just wish it was more intuitive in adding the addresses in Europe versus the U.S.  Secondly this model has an annoying feature that cannot be turned off.  I live near a school zone.  And while I appreciate the safety feature to warn me when entering a school zone with an annoying loud beep, there is no way to disable it.  So I get to hear it every time I leave my house.

B00VJXLCKO,VicTsing Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter Radio Adapter Car Kit with Hands-Free Calling and Music Control,Mobile_Electronics,1,"I was shopping for a way to play music from my phone in an older model car that doesn't have any available methods built in (No 3.5 mm jack, bluetooth, etc.) If I were shopping again, I would not buy this product.<br /><br />If you plan on using this while driving, spend a few hours in the driveway first figuring it out. Starting with the design, there is nothing intuitive about using this device. No matter how you're intending to get your music to the device (sd card, usb, bluteooth), ultimately the point is that it's going to be playing through your radio, so the FM setup is key. This is really tricky to configure and takes a while to get used to. The current station is not displayed, rather you get a really helpful &#34;bt&#34; or &#34;hi&#34; displayed. What station am I on? &#34;bt&#34; Cool. To change the station, or even see the station, you have to press and hold the button on the right. This will not just display but will move the station up 1. If you want to move the station down, you have to hold the button on the right, moving it up one, then quickly use the left button to move the station down before it goes back to the helpful &#34;bt&#34; display. Long press the left button to move it down? Nope. That's just short press (again, only after long pressing the right button.)<br /><br />Several red lights run and cyclists ran over later, I at least had figured out  how to get it to the right station. The pros, well the sound is about as good as you can expect from these types of devices, I've used worse so that was nice. However, and what I'm most disappointed about, is that once you overcome the poor design, the device just doesn't work. The bluetooth connection breaks on average of once per album. On a ten hour road trip, probably 7 or 8 times the music just stopped randomly, and I had to turn it off, turn it back on again, and connect the bluetooth. Again, all things you want to be doing while driving."

B00NUQHSJM,Kingtop Portable Bluetooth Speakers with Unique Wooden Appearance Powerful Sound Speakers for Iphone Ipad Android,Mobile_Electronics,1,"I've been talked into bad products before, and have made my share of mistakes buying things, but this was one of the worst cons I have ever seen. It has some of the worst sound quality I have ever heard. Yes, $120 Chromebooks sound much much better. The static was absurd. I started with the thing 3' away and even on top of the machine, it was so staticy it hurt my ears (there is no volume control for the static). Plugged in with the $0.01 quality cable they sent was just as bad, meaning Bluetooth was not the problem. Unplugging the power supply made me at first think it was the problem, but whoops, ten seconds later, static comes again. That 10 seconds was long enough to hear that the qaulity of the thing was trash.<br /><br />And as for it's looks? The &#34;wood.&#34; Yeah, it ain't wood. The stupid lights are dumb too. Terrible terrible product. I feel disgusting having even bought it and returned it."
B00NBAV2JE,"SpeakStick Waterproof Bluetooth Shower Speaker - Talk Wireless & Listen to Music - With Lifetime Guarantee - Compatible with All Bluetooth Devices: Iphone, Galaxy, Ipad , Tablets & All Other Android Devices - The Highest Quality on the Market!",Mobile_Electronics,4,"This is quite a nice speaker. I didn't even charge this when I received it - I used it right away. I have a Nokia Lumia 1020 (Windows) phone and the speaker connected through bluetooth very fast. I'm semi-pleased with the sound (I had to put my volume all the way up) as it does give a nice sound quality. I used Spotify with this and when I wanted to change a song the button on the speaker (the arrow ones) changed the song without problems! My phone was far away too which is nice to have it not near the bathtub.<br />I must note that the speaker sometimes will fall off from its suctioning within half an hour or so if I suction it really high on the bathtub wall. Sound is much better when it's on the floor of the bathtub though...<br />Also, I tested calling my phone using my dad's phone and clicking the phone button answered his call. I could hear him with decent volume, however, he said that on his line he can hear me garbled.<br />All in all, this is a great bluetooth shower speaker for listening to music. Answering calls however is not ideal.<br />*I bought this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."

However I ran into a number of technical issues which detract from what could have been a nice dash cam.<br /><br />The first unit I received could not advance past the \\""welcome\\"" page.  The return and replacement was easy as anything on Amazon.<br />The second unit records without problems, however many of the files on the micro sd are not viewable. The error reads \\""The format of xxx.mov cannot be detected.\\""  This is a serious problem because unlike many cameras that save small files often this camera saves large files, so if something goes wrong when it saves the entire recording sessions is lost.<br /><br />By trial and error I determined the video files are not saved correctly related to how the dash cam is stopped.  It appears that if I disconnect USB power and let it run for a few minutes on internal battery until it runs out of juice it saves the file the file is saved fine and they can be played back.  However if I stop recording by just turning off ignition in the car (which is what I have always done with the other dash cams) the file is not saved properly and is corrupted. I also was not able to read the file when I used on/off button to turn off the unit itself prior to turning off ignition.<br /><br />On the positive side:<br /><br />✔ Video quality of the dash cam is quite good as you can see in attached video.<br />✔ This camera has an excellent suction cup mount, stayed on even on rough roads.<br />✔ The dash cam uses standard micro USB cables.<br />✔ The cam has an LED display so I can tell that the cam is aimed correctly.  The display flashes a bit as you drive, I have not seen this with the older dash cams we own.<br />✔ Recording starts as soon as it gets power so you don't have to remember to turn it on.<br /><br />The AmorTek package includes the camera, two mini USB cables, and cigarette lighter USB adapter.<br /><br />The user interface is straightforward and even though the manual does not contain details for each button and each option, it contains a picture where each button's function is labelled. I found the manual sufficient to configure my video cam. All defaults are reasonable.<br /><br />Overall, this dash cam has good potential but appears to be an early version which still has some technical issues to iron out especially with reliable saving of files.<br /><br />This video cam is provided by AmorTek. I hope the video helps you see what to expect.<br /><br />Ali Julia reviewd cigarette lighter USB adapter.<br /><br />The user interface is straightforward and even though the manual does not contain details for each button and each option, it contains a picture where each button's function is labelled.

B00SKUYEQI,Buke LED Display Screen Car Parking Reserve Backup Radar Sensor with 4 Sensor Kit Buzzer Alarm,Mobile_Electronics,5,"After selling my 2005 Escape that had factory backup sensors, I just had to have them again in the replacement 2010 Escape. The price was right for this item so I purchased it.<br /><br />First off, a few tools are helpful.  I found that a metric tape measure, soldering gun, round file, fish tape and cable ties made the job much neater and professional looking.<br /><br />The included instruction sheet is worth looking at even though you can install the system without it. There are optimal height and spacing recommendations as well as an acceptable range between the sensors listed on the sheet. I was able to get the height perfect but the spacing between the sensors was just not possible on the Escape. Reinforcements and brackets on the back of the plastic bumper cover were in the way so I had to compromise. I have a little bit of a blind spot if there is something like a pole or other thin vertical item centered behind me. Since I mounted the display on top of the rear view mirror that should not be too much of an issue as I can use the mirror and display together.<br /><br />To start the installation I laid everything out in the back of the SUV, connected all sensor and display cables and spliced the power wire into the backup light to test the system. Note I did not cut the vehicle wire but shaved off a quarter inch of the insulation, separated the strands of both wires, fed and twisted the power wire through the shaved section and soldered the power wire in. Very sleek and secure. A couple of weeks after doing this I found some Scotchlok T-Tap terminals just made for splicing inline. I will use them when I wire up my trailer hitch.<br /><br />Next I put some blue painter's tape on the bumper and experimented with the layout of the sensors. This took much longer than I anticipated but I wanted it to be as functional and good looking as possible.<br /><br />When I was happy with the layout I drilled pilot holes in the plastic and then used the hole saw (included with the kit) to make the holes. Drilling in plastic is easy and it's important to drill slowly. Plastic can melt fairly quickly if the hole saw gets hot. The tape was removed before drilling with the hole saw. You want the holes to be nice and neat because the sensors don't have a lot of play in the mount. A fine round file cleaned up the burrs left behind from the hole saw.<br /><br />The sensors were mounted in the plastic and I started feeding the wires from the driver's side over to the passenger side where I planned on running the wires up into the interior. Cable ties were used to keep things neat. A little extra care had to be taken on the passenger side because of the muffler. Not too difficult, but no sense melting anything.<br /><br />The wires were fed up through a vent which is where I wanted to mount the control box. That was not bad.<br /><br />I drove it like this for a week before attempting to mount the display. I really wanted it above the mirror which meant running the wire above the headliner but thought it would be too difficult. In reality it was a piece of cake. I dropped the interior lights and the sunglass holder and fed the fish tape through one section at a time starting at the front. The only difficult part was from the rear-most light down the corner of the passenger side but even that took maybe 5 minutes.<br /><br />If I was going to complain about anything my rear view mirror has a slight curve to it. The display does not. There is a very slight gap between the two on one end but the double-sided tape still feels secure. Hopefully it will hold up over time.<br /><br />All in all I am happy with the outcome and would purchase this again if my next vehicle needs one.<br /><br />Note: One thing I have not seen mentioned anywhere is there is an on/off switch located on top of the display. It's small, but I was happy to find it. I use a bike rack on occasion and backing up with it can be annoying. The switch shuts off the buzzer but the display is still active. That makes it usable in case I forget to turn the switch back on."

Purchase this product as a way to carry radios in the field hunting. I am an avid archery hunter and backpacker. This product is built in such a way that it will attache in almost any way you can find a place to attache it to a backpack (hunting pack, day pack, overnight pack). As a radio holder it works with almost any radio on the market today. I happen to have both uniden's and Motorola's. It will hold GPS's and anything else you can fit into it because of it's design. HERE IS THE TRUE ULTIMATE USE FOR THIS POUCH. I carry a firearm with me in the field at all times. If Im going lightweight and don't want a heavy weapon such as overnight backpack trips with the family and just need a firearm to scare a bear or ward off a coyote or cougar I will carry my S&W m&p .22lr compact single stack. If I am in need of a bigger cal. I will carry my S&W m&p 9mm compact. (No I don't want to get in a gun debate about what to carry or any of that crap). Those happen to be my two weapons of choice for my own personal reasons. THIS POUCH FITS BOTH WEAPONS EITHER MOUNTED TO THE HIP OF A PACK OR A SHOULDER STRAP NEAR YOUR CHEST. Both weapons fit perfectly and I would suspect any semi auto compact firearm would also fit very similar. I carry my .22 attached to my shoulder strap on my backpack and it's right at my chest ready to go. While hunting I carry my nine on my hip just incase I ever need it. Out of shear dumb luck I was experimenting with this and figured it out. WORKS AWESOME! One of the photos is my .22 and the other is whith my 9mm."

B008RV3DEY,New Uncut Blank Transponder Ignition Key for Toyota Avalon Camry Corolla Rav4 Tundra Yaris Matrix Solara (Chip #4d-67),Mobile_Electronics,4,"DID NOT WORK WITH 2005 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner, although it states it does. Well, it MAY work, but not with the inboard programming I was depending upon to keep this cost reasonable. It'll possibly need expensive programming at a Toyota dealership, (many won't even mess with an 'aftermarket' key and insist you buy theirs), or about $70 at Ace Hardware, which is about half of what most stealerships charge. Only hope now is that Toyota keymaker gadget, (another $15 on Amazon), works to make this more than an expensive door opening key.<br />Edit: 7/31/15: After re-reading the stated facts, it does plainly tell you that you will need to have this key cut and programmed at an automotive locksmith, so it does not provide onboard programming, at least for my model truck. Worked with the seller and I believe they will do a good job of rectifying my situation."

Charging time is good, data transfer has no issues, and I've seen no damage or potential issues with the cables to date.<br /><br />With the cost being a fraction of the cost of Apple cables, and the quality, at minimum, being as good as Apple cables, I'd recommend these cables to anyone needing replacement or additional cables.<br /><br />UPDATE 9-11-2015:<br /><br />These cables are still going strong with no issues with either cable.

I installed it on my secondary vehicle so I haven't tested it at night but I can say it works well during the day.  The viewing angle of the camera is pretty good and the picture on the monitor is sharp.  The power wires on the camera and screen are very thin, so you have to be careful when stripping the wires and connecting them.  All of the wiring is of a good length and should be enough for most vehicles.  I installed mine on a Nissan King Cab Frontier pickup and both the power wires and camera cable reach comfortably with some extra to spare.  The camera comes on right away when shifting into reverse and shuts off right away after shifting out of reverse.  The camera does catch the sunlight and the glare reduces the viewing a bit, but it is still useable.  The product doesn't come with any useable installation instructions but a little bit of know-how will get the job done.  Crawling under the truck and routing the camera cable was the only difficult part. :)"

B00OZGI5T8,VGC VR-6600PRO-A 50 Watts Dual Band Mobile Ham Radio （This Item Not Include BTG-6600A1）,Mobile_Electronics,5,"After installing my shack rig in the truck I needed a replacement for the shack. I had the opportunity to purchase this radio from VeroTelecom and received it quickly. The radio was packed well and all the components were well packed and protected. The power cord is a standard mobile cord so it easily popped into my existing power supply lead, although it does come with and extremely long power cord. The radio is dual fused on the power cable near the back of the radio for good protection. The body of the radio is nice and heavy and feels very solid. nothing rattles or makes noise when you handle it so it would be great in the mobile. The display does not attach to the body of the radio and comes with a long separation cable and a suction cup mount for the control head. I wish some of my other rigs has that feature. The mic can attach both to the base of the radio or the side of the control head making your mounting options plentiful. And, should you not want the mic attached at all, there is a built in microphone in the display you can turn on and either key the radio with the PTT button on the display or set it to vox and go hands free. The control head is well constructed and feels very solid. The buttons do not rattle around like they are lose in the cover, but are nice and tight. The display is self is very large and you can see everything at a glance without having to concentrate too hard which is a bonus for mobile users so you spend less time looking at the display. The menus take a bit of getting used to but after about 5 minutes of actually reading the very well written manual you can find everything you are looking for easily. Operating the radio is very simple, whether you are running VFO or memory. Programming memories from the panel/microphone is easy as well, which is what I did. It took less than 30 minutes to learn how to program the memories and get them all stored. Not quite sure anyone would ever want or need 1000 memory channels but they are there if you need them. Local repeaters and a few simplex frequencies are all I ever need. The included DTMF microphone is nice sized, fits in the palm of my hand well, is back lit, and does not feel cheap, It is solid and does not make any crunching or plastic squeaking noises when you press the PTT button. The mic also has 4 &#34;P&#34; keys are they are called that you can set for various functions normally found in the menus. Power, squelch, repeater offset and a couple others are options to be set for each &#34;P&#34; key. I have used this radio on all bands, 2m, 220 and 440 and have received nothing but good audio reports. Don't let the 1W on 220 bother you too much, 1W does wonders with a decent antenna. I am able to get into all the local 220 repeaters just fine with a simple mag mount inside the house. Power output is select-able and consistent. The base of the radio has the usual data port and speaker jack but also has a line-in port which you can use to pass audio into the rig and you can select line-in as an option on the display as a &#34;band&#34; setting and hear the audio. I could go on and on about this radio but the bottom line is, this is a great rig for the price. It's not your standard Chinese knockoff radio with poor performance and poor workmanship, this radio is built to last and do a great job in the process. If you are looking for a good tri-band, this would be a great choice."

The only knock against it is that the instructions said when charging the light would turn off when full and I had it charging for a few hours and the light never turned off. A minor complaint due to the fact that it gets its own battery life indicator when I connected via bluetooth. I say this is a good one to get.

B00Q6QR8LG,"PIONEER TS-G1645R 6.5"" 250-Watt 2-Way G-Series Speakers",Mobile_Electronics,5,"Several decades ago, I bought my first car, and installed my first sound system in it.  It was a 70 Chevelle with a Sanyo &#34;metal&#34; tape head unit.  It was rated for 8 Ohm speakers (oddly), but could handle 4Ohm.  I installed one pair of 6 X 9&#34; 3-way Pioneer speakers on the rear deck.  I also ran thick speaker wire under the carpet.  The results were amazing.  What I didn't know at the time is that the (trunk) area was the perfect speaker enclosure to really PUSH the bass (low sounds).  And my head unit had enough power to bring the best out of those pioneers.  I was amazed.<br />Fast forward 30 years, and I buy myself a used Hyundai Sonata as a basic transportation appliance.  But I can't stand the factory sound system.  The head unit was replaced with a BOSS brand media receiver (look ma, no cd!)  But I had to replace two sets of speakers on the cheap, also.<br />I was leaning toward Pioneer brand because I knew they could make a good accurate speaker system.  But I was also on a pretty tight budget.  I was happy to find the 1645 model Pioneer 2-way 6.5&#34; speaker system for a very good price.  I wanted larger speakers but had to go with what would fit in the front door panels.<br /><br />First impression...<br />I hated them.  Although the mid-range and treble were more accurate than the factory speakers, that's not saying much.  And bass was ZERO.  Judging by ear alone, the frequency response dropped at least 10dB around 200Hz and below, which is terrible.<br />I wasn't too concerned about the lack of bass, as I still needed to order some 6 x 9 speakers for the rear deck.  I knew from experience that the 6 x 9 rear deck speakers would have PLENTY of bass...<br />Because I live overseas, I had to wait a few weeks for the 6 X 9 speakers.  During that time, I continued to use the factory speakers on the rear deck, along with the new Pioneer 6.5&#34; speakers in the front door panels<br /><br />Fast forward a few weeks...<br />One of my favorite songs came on and I cranked it up to mid-loud levels (not super loud, but enough to push a good volume of air).  I was surprised to both hear AND FEEL a super low-end response from the FRONT speakers.  My pant legs were vibrating.  That only happens when woofers move a LOT of air.  Anyway, these 1645 model speakers sound like crap UNTIL THEY ARE BROKEN IN.  After they are broken in though, they have amazing bass response.<br /><br />A few more weeks...<br />With brand new JVC 6 X 9 speakers on the rear deck (couldn't get the Pioneers here...not for a reasonable price anyway).  The JVC speakers are NOT broken in yet.  So the Pioneer 6.5&#34; speakers are still providing most of the bass...<br />I was listening to most of my favorite music and my impression of the Pioneer speakers is that they had AMAZING, accurate BASS response, as well as &#34;smooth&#34; (not irritating) and accurate treble...but where was the mid-range?  Over and over, with any type of music...my impression was the same.  The BASS is there, the TREBLE sounds very pleasing...where is the mid-range?<br />I finally figured out my head unit was mis-adjusted.  If you use the bass/treble controls to adjust the sound output of the BOSS media receiver, it seems to de-emphasize mid-range.  while this seems the way bass/treble controls SHOULD work...the end result seems to be an actual *attenuation* of the mid-range levels, as opposed to just emphasizing bass and treble over it...<br /><br />After playing around with the various controls of the Boss media receiver head unit...<br />I figured out the &#34;Rock&#34; EQ setting is the best setting for the Pioneer speakers.  With this setting, the BASS is not quite emphasized as much as I'd like it to be.  HOWEVER, the mid-range sounds beautiful and the treble is &#34;just right&#34;.  It is a well-balanced sound that you can turn up as loud as you want, without it being annoying at all...<br /><br />Bottom line, these Pioneer speakers have the potential to be very accurate sounding speakers, if you have a decent head unit that is properly adjusted.  BUT NOTE THEY REQUIRE A LONG BREAK-IN PERIOD!!!urate sounding speakers, if you have a decent head unit that is properly adjusted.  BUT NOTE THEY REQUIRE A LONG BREAK-IN PERIOD!!!"

B00HR5SE72,DC 12V Volume Control Knob Car Stereo Power Amplifier Silver Tone,Mobile_Electronics,5,"More powerful than I thought, the fuse in the photo (blue maxi) indicates as a 15 ampre fuse, but it's actually a 30 ampre (green maxi) fuse.  The amp itself has questionable efficiency, so I'm not sure how much power is being released as heat and how much is being put into the audio wave to the speakers, the amp kind of got warm after short usage on low volume during bench testing so i'm guessing somewhere in the 70-75% efficiency range.  This amp blew the inline 15 ampre fuse I had when the bass dropped (not the one on the amp, the fuse closer to the battery), so it's definitely pulling the power an amp like this should, it shook my rearview for the brief 2 seconds the fuse didn't break so once I have it all running properly again, this will be a great amp.<br /><br />The shipping time was longer than expected, I thought it was shipping from somewhere in the US, but it actually came from Hong-Kong and should have taken 2 months to get here, it arrive 1.5 months early (aka 2 weeks).  I bought another amp and planned to sell this when it got here, but as of now (July 16, 2015) this amp arrived before the other did.  I have woofers just laying around, I'm gonna get another enclosure and put the woofers in it and use it as an all in one unit, for now it'll sit in a box until I have everything organize.  Do not be afraid to buy this amp (and cooling fan), it was a good buy."

We charged it as soon as it came out the package and charging was pretty fast. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be (that is not a big issue I am actually glad its small). The suction cup sticks really well to the shower wall, actually it sticks well to almost anything. I did buy the blue one as you can see. It is a pretty blue and the top of it is squishy which I was not expecting as well. For a little speaker it is pretty loud. Which is also a plus. I did receive the speaker at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. However, all thoughts and opinions are my own. Overall my husband and I both really love this speaker."

B00KOEOOYU,ComNav Mariner X2 AIS Class B Transceiver w/Built-in GPS,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Works just fine.  It took about a day for the unit to become fully functional.  I was able to test the unit by using the Boat Watch app on my cell-phone.  My boat chartplotter also picks-up the signal.  So, I suppose it also appears on the chartplotters and radars of other boats and ships that receive AIS.  My reason for purchasing the unit is to be seen at night and in the fog.  I fish (recreationally) in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  I had to buy a separate signal splitter, otherwise I would have needed a second vhf antenna.  I do not understand why the splitter was not built into the unit.  Also, the unit does not have a switch to turn-off the transmitter, which means it transmits continuously.  Other brands offer this feature.  I paired the unit to a Lowrance signal splitter and to a Lowrance chartplotter using NMEA 2000 cables.  No problems with the set-up."

It's not 7000 watts but it's definitely more than anyone needs ...if you get a quality 15 inch like me and put it in a gigantic tuned box, use this amp with a huge capacitor (I have a power grid) you'll have more than enough bang for your buck. I've spent almost a grand for an amp that was this loud.. If you want more than that your going to go deaf in a few months...Definitely worth the money!! and as with any lesser name amp NEVER TURN UP past 80% or three weeks later you go to turn it on and its dead...I've been pushing it<br /> for a few months hard now and still consistently hits really nice, deep lows...Definitely made me rethink trusting small companies to produce extremely high quality products.

The radio has nice sound quality, incoming audio is clear and volume loud.With a little practice and patience the programming sequence is not difficult to manually program. (It is a little frustrating at first until you get it figured out) The current software needs more input fields to make it more functional ant easier to use.

It arrived visually good, but doesn't work with my Anker charger to my Samsung S4. In fact, it trips some kind of circuit in my charger and I had to unplug to replug to reset the charger so it'll then work again with the cables attached to it. I'm utterly disappointed and it's going to be returned tomorrow...PRONTO. I don't like returning things too much in fear of being blacklisted, but I can't avoid this one. Pissed. I'm upset I have to make a trip to the carrier to return it. I almost lost my charger and have to buy a new one. I bought these cables after some further research that quicker charge requires a lower gauge rating (to the limit IC circuits understand the maximum amount of current to send through the wire without frying the device). I already isolated USB cables in my house that are 'thin' versus those that are 'thick'.<br /><br />Did I mention I bought it because of all the good reviews? I'm just very disappointed that I feel like the odd duckling."

I like that is lightweight.  It makes it easier to carry around and is very portable.  It doesn't take up much space either which is a big deal for me as I move into a smaller space! Since I love music and the majority of my music is accessible from my phone I was very happy to try this product out at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The sound is clear and the lights are fun.  It has a few different modes of lights which I found to be pretty enjoyable to watch, especially in a dark place.  They show up surprisingly well in well lit areas too though. It goes great with my lava lamp near my gaming console.  The volume is adjustable and I found it to put out a good amount of volume.  I didn't find the sound to be muted or tinny.  For such a small device it packs a punch. At this price range I find the sound pretty exceptional.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this is that the plastic around the lights scratches pretty easily.  Since mine sits in a dark corner most the time since that's where it looks good it isn't a huge deal for me, but I definitely could see this being more important for people who have it in a more obvious location.  Even with this issue though I'm very happy with the product since the sound is of good quality and the lights are unique and add some fun to the device!"

Problems: the firmware is flaky and updates are either identical or unimproved.  The menu is confusing, made worse by a manual written by a non-English speaker that does not appear to have any knowledge of the unit itself.  Basically, it is worthless.  If you're using a wired connection to a speaker or headphones, the Ruizu X06 is marginally acceptable.  Load a bunch of songs, play them, get sound.  The bluetooth function, however, is another story.  First, it is VERY difficult to configure (no help from the manual), and it disables most of the other functions of the unit: playlists, formats other than MP3, and bluetooth quits if any of the other functions or menus are used. Personally, this would be an ideal gift to give somebody you would like to inflict an ulcer upon!"

I use this every time in the car and never once has there been a problem. I've also had it for upwards of a year. Its a very strong FM transmitter which means you can hear no static when nothing is playing. The only thing that interferes with my device is my smart phone itself. Like if you are using the internet it will cause the device to emit static like sounds. This is easily fixed by putting the phone in airplane mode/not being on the internet/ and not having the phone right next to the device. I strongly recommend this FM transmitter.

B00UBWD8SS,fitTek&reg; Updated 2nd Gen Car HUD Vehicle-mounted Head up Display System OBD Projection Display with Overspeed Warning,Mobile_Electronics,2,"I bought this mostly as a temperature gauge for my X308 Jaguar XJR 2000, since the dashboard gauge is not really a gauge, just a pointer which is most likely to alert you to overheating after it's too late to save your cooked engine.  It works randomly, as in I frequently need to disconnect and reconnect for a correct reading. Sometimes no reading when car started, sometimes lights show random patterns unrelated to anything obvious.  Would much prefer a normal display rather than mirror image, and leave it mounted somewhere in front of dashboard instead of as a HUD on top of the dashboard. In bright sunshine, windscreen reflection is unreadable without the tinted plastic sheet attached to window. I don't know what it's like with the sheet attached I haven't tried it but I wouldn't expect much improvement.  I leave it half stuck in the cassette unit and have learnt to read mirror image digits.  Instruction manual almost useless but it's not too difficult to figure out basic operation anyway. Just plug it in, press buttons randomly to change the display until you get what you want.  Brightness switch very difficult to move and display goes bright and dim randomly anyway."

Has pretty decent sound and is quite loud for a shower or bathroom or anywhere you can use the suction cup to mount it.  Really nice design and nice rubberized feel to it.  The buttons are really easy to push with the rubber covers over them.  You will feel them click below the cover.  Easy to pair this to any device.  It paired first try with my Galaxy Note 4 and my son's iPad mini.  No issues at all there.  It lists this as a waterproof shower speaker, but I preferred to mount it on the mirror across from the shower.  Haven't tried it actually in the shower, so I cannot speak on the validity of the waterproof, but from other reviews here it does look like it would be great in the shower.  I wanted to keep it where my wife could use it also while taking a bath.  The tub is on the other side of the bathroom and I didn't want to limit it to only the shower itself.  Having it out on the mirror makes it work in the whole bathroom.  The sound from this is very good.  Nice and loud with good sound.  Nice highs and mids and decent lows.  Nothing earth shattering by any means, but majority of these smaller bluetooth type speakers aren't.  But it does produce a very good sound and I was impressed by how loud it gets.  It can be used pretty much anywhere you can stick it to.  I may pick up a couple more to use in our other bathroom and our kitchen.  Very happy with this speaker.  Highly recommended!!  I received this product at a discounted price to provide my fair and honest opinion.  This is my opinion based on testing and reviewing the item."

I'm a cheapo, so I was looking for something that would be functional, but not put a huge dent in my pocket.  I love the removable keyboard.  It's great when lending the tablet to a niece or nephew to be able to take it off.  The keyboard is easy to pair, functional, and not so small that it's really hard to get used to typing on.  The only issue I've run into with the keyboard is that it gets really spazzy once it's battery is low.  You also don't know when that is because there is no indicator light, but it takes more than a day for it to start being silly, so it's   As to the case itself:  The design is good, it fits the keyboard and tablet very nicely.  The clips are nice and hold the tablet firmly.  I love the magnetic back stand.  The only issue I have with the case is that the outer pretend leather is a little loose from the inner fabrics in places where it bends and pulls after less than a month of use.  As a seamstress, I don't foresee the joints being an issue.  However, the fake leather under the back stand is loose and the ribbon that holds it from spread eagle-ing is only sewn to that.  I could see it being ripped off with one good yank from a small   Update - 1/2 month later:  The usb port for the keyboard literally came out.  Apparently it did not have enough support around it in order to keep it secure. The port was holding tighter to my cord than to the keyboard......could explain glitchyness.   I am not sure if this is the case for all, or just an instance of defect.  However, I am going to contact the company and see what I can find out."

The One Star rating is because these headphones truly last about 6-8 months before one headphone loses all sound. I went through two pairs before buying a third and realizing that there is a one-year warranty from the company. The company either doesn't honor this warranty, or it was an operator error as I tried to get through the warranty process. The phone number they provide doesn't work (there is a recording, but it goes to nothing even during their &#34;operating hours&#34;), and the form online says that you will get a response within 7 days, but I have yet to receive an email from them following up for the warranty (and I contacted them more than a month ago).

I've tried it in several vehicles with my GoPro and it worked great. What I did was stick a GoPro mount on the flat center surface, and then slide a GoPro bracket in to hold the camera. This worked out better than I anticipated.<br /><br />Btw, I'm sure it would work great with the suction cup of a GPS as well. Anyhow, I can't wait to use it on my next overseas trip."

B00WOE23WI,"CASKA X Mirror - World's Best Smart Rearview Mirror with Dash Cam Video Recorder, GPS Navigation, Bluetooth, Rear View Camera",Mobile_Electronics,5,"Frankly, I had no idea this kind of integrated product even existed - it blows my mind!  Now that I have it installed and been using if for a few days, I had to look about Amazon to see if there were similar products.  There are actually quite a few, and from the feedback on other products that I have read, it looks like Caska got a great one here.  I don't have any direct comparison, yet the experience of literally catapulting my old Chevy S10 on technological par with luxury vehicles makes me grin even now as I type this.<br /><br />According to feedback I have read, I guess the number one issue with others is a dim daylight reflection.  My Chevy S10 has a covered camper bed, and I have no issue with clarity or shadowing during the day and night (I don't normally drive the truck at night, but I did take it for a quick jaunt last night).  Paired up and uploaded my smartphone's contact list, and it's pretty neat having an integrated navigation.  The Samsun Galaxy S6 has a bit of a deserved reputation of being a battery hog, so I was considering putting in a wireless QI charger mound for it, but nothing I could find online would have done well in the limited spacing/configuration in my truck.  This answered all that and more, including acting as a forward/rear dashcam monitor, something I would never have had space to install separately.  Mine didn't come with a rear camera, just a forward facing internal, but I am looking for one now - I have tried a few in the past, loving being able to see below my bed gate, yet just didn't have any practical placement for a monitor except on the center hump floor (which I ended up not caring for at all).<br /><br />Being an Android OS guy, I did find the WindowsCE based UI a different feel, but everything fairly self-explanatory... which is good because the one gripe I do have is there was no installation manual included (although it is listed as being included here on the product page), and the Operating Instructions is more of a brief &#34;Quick Start&#34; pamphlet.  The full eManual is available in the system, yet I really would have liked having at least a Personal Computer PDF copy or such.  I did Google about, using various key words, looking for a web-source, but came up empty.  I would dock a star for that, but in the end, it didn't really matter.<br /><br />One of my younger brothers recently got a 2012 Jeep Wrangler, and for once it was him being green-eyed with envy (and not me over his fun Jeep compared to my old beast).  He has already firmly declared his is buying one too.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes.tart&#34; pamphlet.

I couldn't believe how good it is. I understand it can't be as good as a professional sound system but this little thing doesn't sound tinny at all, it doesn't seem to distort the sound at higher levels either. If you are a sound efficiento then this probably wouldn't be good enough but for me it is great. I can pick it up and go anywhere with it, it sounds good and doesn't take up much room. I would definitely buy this again."

I like that it has a little light on it. Makes it awesome to use in the dark outside when I am hanging out with the family outside watching the stars.<br />This speaker does put out some sound.  I like that I can either make it quiet or loud and that is awesome.  The sound is still clear when I turn it all the way up.<br />There are two reasons that I am giving this speaker 4 star review. One is because I actually had a rough time getting it to connect with my phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3. It took me about 15 minutes to get it to connect with my phone. The other is because when I am playing music and I try to turn up the sound on the speaker itself it will change to the next song because the sound buttons are also the skip buttons. Other than these two reasons this is a great speaker.<br />I did get this product with a promotional discount in exchange for my honest review. I am not compensated in any way for this review.

Only down side is IF you are just wearing a polo type shirt only (no jacket) where do you hook it to keep it from pulling you shirt off!  Device works well and seems to be solidly made (so far).

It is really annoying to try to raise the volume and accidentally skip forward to the next song. Or try to go back a song, and instead lower the volume. Long press vs short press is a really inexact control system and is simply unnecessary. Would 2 more buttons have been that difficult to do or raised the price that much? I highly doubt it. Dumb bit of design in an otherwise very good product."

Heat shrink tubing to cover the solder leads is available at most auto supply stores. When soldering the two wires of the new battery - use a small soldering iron that does not put out too much heat.<br /><br />After replacement, the new battery lasted approximately 9 hours (3 each 3 hour outings) before needing to be recharged - much better than the one old one it replaced!"

I purchased this to used with my HTC One M9. First, the spring loaded micro USB makes it very difficult to dock. Second it is so light weight when you un-dock it it takes two hands and some jiggling to finally get it un-docked. Thirdly it never seemed to charge my phone . Every time, about 4 times, I would put my phone to  charge on my nightstand at night. I would go to sleep with the phone saying it is charging. Then I would wake up to a phone with 0% battery and the phone having turned itself off  (the alarm never having gone off, resulting in me over sleeping). In my mind this dock does nothing that a dock is supposed to. A simple and convenient way to charge or sync your phone."

It programs very much like many of the other China radios right from the front panel, no computer needed.<br />I could not get the voice scrambler to work but have not fiddled with it much yet, perhaps it needs an optional module? Low power was set too high on both bands, around 15 watts, but high power meets specifications or close enough. Receiver is good and does not have near the intermodulation products on VHF compared to the Leixen VV-898. Transmitted audio quality is very decent. Not the greatest mobile in the world but certainly worth every penny for the price. A fun inexpensive dual band to play with and certainly useful."

I will let you know how well it worked after we return from our trip.  Update:  This product is not water proof or water resistant.  Even with the slightest about of rain, it allows water in.

B00N2NCUFK,GoldQ Ultra Thin 2.3mm Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Case Stand Protector for 5'' Cellphone Sony l39H HTC New One Samsung Galaxy S3,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I must admit, I get quite a few second-looks from people who see this attached to my Incipio case (same color pattern, yellow and grey).  I am not sold on the scissor-key this product claims to have, but have been unwilling to ruin the device by cutting it open to prove or disprove that it is not simply a membrane key (it feels like it is).  Aside from this, it is functional, and I can type relatively well on it with the use of my Kindle Paperwhite as a sort of lap-desk.  There is one glaring omission, however.  That being the absence of an apostrophe key anywhere on the keyboard.  Honestly, they included a back and home button but not an apostrophe!?  Not being able to type in contractions (cannot instead of can't), or assign possession to something (Bob's keyboard) can be a hindrance.<br /><br />Aside from this, the short-comings mentioned by other reviewers hold true.  The spring brace used to prop the phone up should be mounted slightly slanted, as mounting it straight (along with the adhesive pad that attaches it) causes the phone to &#34;lean&#34; to the left a bit when used."

It is easy to configure, and fits easily in the pocket.  The USB interface to the computer was a snap as Windows 7 loaded the drivers itself from Windows Update.

Transmit audio is good.  Radio needs to be mounted such that radio gets plenty of clearance for air flow to all sides of the unit.  It gets very hot if not mounted that way.  The supplied mounting bracket needs to be attached as it becomes part of the heat sink.  I bought the programming cable and had trouble using the front panel and microphone key pad for programming (too many steps).  It seems slightly worse for intermod when compared to my older Icom radio.  The users manual would benefit from a better translation into English. Overall the unit is satisfactory.<br /><br />Update to Review.  Radio transmitter failed a few weeks after initial review.  The radio was mailed back in August, but Seller claims it is not received.  Seller insisted on USPS for return, so no tracking is possible.  Now I am out initial price plus the quite expensive return shipping.  I will update if radio is returned repaired as Seller promised."

Was when i learned 85% of drivers in Russia have cameras in their vehicles. I love it.! I travel The east coast of the USA quite a bit of the year. When in heavy traffic, I have the security of knowing what's going on in my truck and outside. The audio even picks up outside! One day someone backed into my truck, leaving a dent in my bumper. Little did they know my camera auto stores video upon impact. I Win! That person was arrested for leaving the scene of an accident and had to pay for my bumper to be replaced, I'm sure there were additional court costs as well. My Insurance Agent loves this too."

Exactly as described with a clear loud sound. I love listening to podcasts in the shower. Next time I tried to use it, though, it would not turn on when detached from the power cord, even with a full charge. I can still use it when plugged in, though, but that is not much use in the shower. Reading some of these reviews it looks like a number of defective items were shipped."
B00M49C6MK,Sentey Ls 4162,Mobile_Electronics,5,"My husband loves Bluetooth speakers and so I wanted to get this one to add to our collection. We ordered the blue one but they do sell it in other colors. This speaker is amazing. We paired it with my husbands android phone so he could listen to music at work and while grilling outside. We paired it as soon as he got it and the sound quality is great. The music is so clear and it is really loud. I called him while he had the music playing and we were able to talk through the speaker. The range on it is great to, it can go up to 33 foot so you can work in the yard or garden and still be able to hear it easily. The next day he took it to work with him and played it for over 8 hours and it still had battery life to it. To charge it all we had to do was use the usb cord and plug it in for a few hours. Everyone at work kept asking him where he got it and if we could order them one. I Have to say it holds up pretty well to. My husband accidentally knocked it off the porch and I was really surprised that it didn't break and still worked perfectly. This is our favorite Bluetooth speaker and we plan on buying one in each color. I received this product as a sample to test and review. This review is solely my opinion. The information provided is what I experienced."

I received it for free to review honestly and started using it right out of the box. I did a few audio tests and it can handle bass well, despite it's size. The high notes are fine. Here is a list that breaks down what I think about it:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Light weight<br />- Loud, crisp sound with no buzzing<br />- Easy to connect<br />- Comes with a charging cable and a male-male 3.5mm aux cable.<br />- Durable enough for average use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Bluetooth connection sometimes has a hard time going through certain materials.<br />- When you turn the music all the way up it makes a beep and stops playing for a couple seconds before resuming."

(At least not that I found, more on that in a minute.) You just have to skip through until you find the one you want.<br />Next, the manual was of no help at all in figuring anything out. You just have to push a bunch of buttons until something happens and then hope whatever happened was what you wanted.<br />Third, the buttons barely function at all. They would nearly always stick or double click. Plus every button appeared to have multiple functions making everything even more confusing and frustrating.<br />The thing is cheaply made and very disappointing. It's nearly impossible to use.

B00WHZHSRO,Ideashop® ELM327 V1.5 USB Scanner Interface OBDII OBD2 Auto CAN-BUS Diagnostic Interface Scanner DTC Trouble Fault Code Reader Scan Tool For OBDII Protocols,Mobile_Electronics,2,"While this seems like a quality cable, it just doesn't function with my automotive diagnostic software. The ELM327 chip  in this device must be a counterfeit chip. I did not open the case up to see if it were a genuine yellow ELM327 chip, but based on the fact that it doesn't work with my software and information which I found on the ELM chip manufacturer website, it is my best judgment to say that this is a fake chip. While looking for the latest driver on the Prolific software website I stumbled across the instructions for connecting the cable to a PC, which clearly state that if there is a yellow warning symbol on the com port in  device manager (in Windows) then it is most likely that the chip is a clone. Sure enough... I have the yellow warning label on both of my PCs. I attempted to hook the ELM327 up to 4 different software programs on 2 different PC without success. The software that comes with the cable does work , but is very basic and has a rather ugly interface (baud rate needs to be changed to 38400 for the port in device manager (Windows) and within the program in order for it to read the cable). I am sending my cable back and going to look for either a genuine ELM327 cable or get a stn1110, which supposedly is a superior chip set and works will all ELM327 software. Save yourself a headache and hours of messing around and buy a genuine cable."

B00Z8D8VM8,"Thor 64 GB Slim 1.8"" LCD Mp3 Mp4 Player Media/Music/Audio Player with accessories(Purple Color)",Mobile_Electronics,1,"I was hoping that this player would be a suitable replacement for my beloved 30g Classic iPod, which is on its last gears and would cost me hundreds of dollars to replace (if I can even find a classic replacement), but it's an absolute FAIL.  The &#34;best&#34; thing I can say about this player, is that the radio works well, and the color is a beautiful shade of purple.  However, I'm not looking for a radio, and &#34;beautiful&#34; has zero effect on function/usefulness. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would. Well, maybe a 1/2 star, for the radio.<br /><br />The player - which did arrive ahead of estimated delivery time and was nicely packaged - comes with a USB cord and earphones. The player itself is tiny (see photo of it next to iPod) - about 1 1/2&#34; X 3 1/2&#34; total and about 1/4&#34; thick. It's lighweight, cheap feeling plastic. It has a click wheel like my iPod's. The screen is about 1&#34; X 1 1/18&#34;. It's a beautiful shade of purple. The only instructions it came with, was a &#34;quick start&#34; guide, which turned out to be totally useless, and the hand drawn pictures of the player's click wheel do NOT match the actual wheel on the player or its functions, and the wheel itself was hit/miss as to what it would do when clicked.<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on my computer and connected the player to charge it.  My PC promptly flashed a message saying new hardware had been detected, and telling me it needed to be formatted.  Not good.  If you format something, it wipes out what's on there. Nope, don't want to format.  Saying no to formatting kept me from being unable to &#34;see&#34; the player on my PC.  I try unplugging/replugging the player. Same thing.<br /><br />Next, I tried looking through the device itself.  It came preloaded with 2 songs, a video, and several games.  I plugged the player into some external speakers, and was able after several attempts at manuvering the horrible click wheel, to play both songs and the video. Sound and video quality were OK, given the size of the screen. I couldn't manage the click wheel or viewing on the tiny screen, to successfully play any of the games.  The only thing I was able to make work with any consistency, was the radio.<br /><br />I never found anything on the device itself that needed to be addressed before I should have been able to load my own content via my PC. By all logic,  it shouldn't have been much different than loading music/videos onto a flash drive. After an hour of frustration, I disconnected the player and waited for my husband to get home from work.  He couldn't get the player to work either - and he has a degree in computer science!  He confirmed that formatting wipes out everything. He couldn't get the click wheel to work correctly.  He pointed out that the video formats - AMV and MTV - are obscure.  And, he wholeheartedly agrees that this player is JUNK.<br /><br />While I in no way expected this device to be anywhere near the quality of my iPod, to say that I am severely disappointed with its quality and functionality, is an understatement. It's totally useless to me. I will be contacting Amazon/the seller for a FULL refund.ality were OK, given the size of the screen.

B00A2XV0VI,"Tech-Life BeatBlock - Wireless Bluetooth Speaker: Rechargeable, Ultra-Durable and Splashproof (Bombproof Rubber Exterior-Black)",Mobile_Electronics,5,"I ordered this speaker in August, 2013.  I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but I knew that I wasn't impressed with many of the speakers available at that time.  I have to say, I was beyond impressed with the BeatBlock.  The build quality was excellent, and the sound volume and quality absolutely blew away anything you could sample at the stores, even those costing twice as much.  I was amazed at the quality of sound it could produce from such a small speaker.  Music was clear, and the bass was solid.  I also found that putting it on wood, such as a wooden table or desk, would increase the quality of the low end, as the bottom firing bass speaker could use the wood surface to resonate more.  Spoken words, such as podcasts, were also very clear and loud; easily heard from one room to another, and I have used it as a speaker for presentations and adult classes I give in moderate to large sized classrooms.  I found I consistently got over 8 hours from each charge, even now, after almost 2 years of use, a charge still lasts all day.<br /><br />The exterior is a rugged rubberized finish, which has held up to a lot of moving and activity over the last 2 years.  I constantly carry it with me, and it gets banged around in my computer bag or backpack, and with even a few drops from table or desk height, and the rubber finish shows no signs of wear.  I have not exposed it to any water, so I do not know its water resistance.<br /><br />When I purchased this speaker 2 years ago, it simply blew everything else away that was available at the time.  There was no comparison.  It was far superior to the Beats line of speakers, and everyone else's speakers in the price range were trash. The small, portable bluetooth speaker market has exploded over the last couple of years, with quality companies such as JBL, Altec Lansing, and others, producing new, high quality speakers that are much improved over their previous incarnations.  I'd like to think that this product was one of the reasons why the bigger companies had to step up their games; it was just that good, and cost less than $100.  Now, you may find speakers that sound as good, but I have to say, after 2 years of hard use, this speaker was worth every penny."

I previously owned a plug to phone unit that shorted out. I turned to this unit for ease of use, but was apprehensive. Delivery was on time and packaging was protective. I read the instructions and followed them to a T. Everything worked as advertised without exception. Pairing with my S4 was easy and permanent. My suggestion is that you turn your phone off first and reboot before you start. Ialso read of cassette deck issues which showed up on my previous (different) device. No issues there. I regularly clean the deck with a cassette designed for that use. I noticed a slight (10%) lowering of sound amplication but this was not a deal changer. I wish you the same success. One more item. The charger holds advertised power. Ine difference, I don't leave the unit in the vehicle due to the amount of heat and/or cold which could damage the unit. I also charge it at home when blinking led advises recharging. The mictophone has worked w/o issue and I have had no complaints from callers or callees. 8/1...So the trick I learned is not to leave this unit in the car during hot or cold days. Unit is working as advertised and as experienced."

The install went fairly smooth as the instructions are very clear. It took roughly 4 hours to install, but that was being very tedious and careful.<br /><br />I love the unit because you can integrate your Apple products such as iPods, iPhones, etc and still retain the steering wheel control functions such as volume, skip, etc. The downside is that the standard cord to connect such devices is the old cord, not the newer lightning cable.<br /><br />The unit is still very useful despite this fact (after upgrading to an iPhone 6). I can still use an aux cable (purchased a cheap hookup from radio shack for around $10) to connect any mp3 device and still stream my music. While I can't control skip I can still use the volume function from the steering wheel.<br /><br />Overall 4 stars, if it had the newest lightning cable or switch out to a mini usb for android phones it would have received a 5."

B0013TQ6FK,MRP-M500 - Alpine Monoblock 500 Watt RMS Power Amplifier,Mobile_Electronics,5,This amp is absolutely fantastic.  I've used it extensively for 5 years.

B00MNG787M,CCD Sony chip Car Back Up Rear View Reverse Reversing Parking Camera for TOYOTA Land Cruiser Prado LC 100 120 4500 4700 Series,Mobile_Electronics,1,"This camera is of very low quality.  The image quality is lower than I expected, I realize its low priced but was expecting a better quality picture.  The housing and wiring is also of even lower quality, the &#34;water proofing&#34; looks like consisted of someone slapping some rtv silicone around the inlet of the wiring into the camera casing, very sloppy job smeared around the cables.  The casing although was meant for the 100 Series Land Cruiser did not snap in correctly, one of the &#34;wing&#34; pieces had to be trimmed because the plastic was too big.  I would return this product if it all was not already all wired in and installed and trimmed to fit.  The wire for powering the camera is extremely cheap made, if you pull on it too much it tears the copper wires inside the rubber tubing. Camera was not coming on and I couldn't figure out why... till I noticed how easy the power wires tore, I figured out it wasn't getting power.  You can't even tell the wires are tore because the rubber casing stretches but the wires don't and snap! I do not recommend this product.  Spend 2-3 dollars more and get something of better quality.  The quality of this camera made the install almost not worth it."

Remote didn't work so I went in search of this CR2025 battery thinking maybe it was just a dud battery. Long story short after spending $3 on a new battery, I realized the owners manual and the actual remote say CR2025 but the actual battery it fits is MUCH smaller! I was so annoyed and out of time. I purchased a better stereo with a working remote in a store and returned this one. $17 to ship it back so I am out a total of $20 because they are selling a product that is mislabeled and doesn't work.

B00MFM8AUI,"Lumsing&reg; Portable NFC Bluetooth Speaker,Rechargeable Battery Powerful Sound Bass System for iPhone iPad MP3 Player Smartphones Laptop",Mobile_Electronics,5,"I'm somewhat of an audiophile, and I've spent more money than I'd like to admit over my lifetime on speakers.  Knowing how a really good speaker sounds, does this speaker measure up?  Heck no!  As is typical of cheaper speakers, the treble is too forward, the mid-range is underrepresented, and the bass lacks punch.  If you turn it up loud, it will distort.  So why the 5-star review?  Because this speaker is that impressive- for the price.  It packs in connectivity to devices via Bluetooth and NFC, via microSD card, and via an Aux In port.  On-board volume/track-skip controls, play/pause, and call answer are included in the package.  It packs in a 2x3w class D amplifier, 2 full range drivers, and a passive radiator for improved bass response.  You get a built-in rechargeable battery.  And it does all of this and sounds better than it has any right to- for the price.  You're not going to use this effectively for music at a backyard barbecue, but it works just fine as a personal music listening device, and that little passive radiator pumps out a surprising amount of bass.  By no means is this a great-sounding speaker, but it is a great value.  For the price- there's an awful lot to love."

I use only the 1080p option and not 720p as the picture is crisp with the 1080p option.  Capacitor version does not allow one to take photo when the unit is disconnected from the power supply.  Battery version allows a few minutes of operation without power cord.  Since my goal is keeping the dash cam to do just what it's designed for, capacitor version suits me better in that way."

Ours have used it quite a bit to listen to music during their outdoor activities (biking, hiking, swimming). Since the music controls are on the speaker, I don't to hand over my phone/tablet to them (and worry about them losing my device or mishandling it). The sound quality is average - little bit on the tinny side but at this price point, I wouldn't expect to get the rich, deep sound from the speaker. The construction of the device is solid, and ours has taken quite a bit of physical and weather-related abuse from being in the outdoors. Overall, I'd wholly recommend this to any parent with 6-10 year olds."

It's obviously an iPod knock-off with a number of extras features so l decided to give it a shot.  It plays MP3 files, the FM tuner works and I am able to view photos but it does NOT play MP4 video files.  To me this seems extremely odd because that file format is specifically in the description of the device.  The directions provided are very limited and next to useless.  What little I could decipher from the manual and reading over the description once again, is that only the AMV and possibly MTV video formats are supported.  Unfortunately I cannot find a free converter to transcode existing videos into those specific formats.<br /><br />As others mentioned the interface isn't great and the buttons are physically loud when navigating through the menus.  I have not yet tried the other features.  For now I will keep it to just play music files."

B00M49C6MK,Sentey Ls 4162,Mobile_Electronics,5,The Sentey® Bluetooth Stereo Speaker B-trek S4 (Blue) is absolutely a great speaker to have! I did give this to my roommate because her favorite color is blue and she absolutely loves it! Her room and my room are on the opposite side of the house and when she's playing her music with this speaker I can actually hear her music. It also works very well when someone calls. Her daughter called her while she was listening to her music and I could hear every word that was said and her daughter was surprised to know that she was actually talking to her through this speaker and not through the actual phone. This bluetooth speaker might be smaller than a lot of bluetooth speakers but it's better than a lot of bigger ones that I've seen! I would definitely recommend!<br /><br />**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**

You can scroll through tracks by pushing it, or increase volume by holding it down. It would work much better the other way around. Skipping tracks takes a long time, and it doesn't shuffle at all."

B00OYVJLZQ,"Pioneer AVH-X7700BT 7"" Flip-Out DVD Receiver with Bluetooth, Siri and Pandora",Mobile_Electronics,3,"I would give this 5 stars IF the most important [to me] features worked. The single biggest reason I went with this model is the Mirrorlink function for android phones - effectively adding the best navigation because you can supposedly mirror most apps including Google maps from your phone, and control them from the touchscreen. However after installing Mirrorlink does not work with my Galaxy S6. Research revealed incompatibility with the Samsung Galaxy S5 and S6. HOWEVER they are NOW listed as certified compatible on mirrorlink site as of 3 months ago. I thought I may need to upgrade firmware on the stereo, but it was shipped with the newest 8.31 version from 2 months ago. So I do not know why it does not work. I will be contacting pioneer and will update this review if they can make it work as advertised.  UPDATE: This is due to misleading advertising, although not technically incorrect. Here goes. I did get the mirrorlink to work, but it is only the base mirrorlink. In other words the &#34;your favorite apps&#34; is BS. It only supports the 5 proprietary apps listed on mirrorlink.com (NOT your apps). Only one of them can be considered even slightly useful, Sygic navigation, and only because it has downloaded offline maps in case you have zero service on your phone. This could come in handy in that rare occasion but I've used it and it is inferior in every other aspect. I will definitely keep using Google maps on my phone instead. Now for the final explanation. Some radios with Mirrorlink can mirror all of the Google apps like Google maps. That is by using Android Auto. It is a new, seprate app. I found that the EU version of this (8800bt) lists Android Auto compatibility as a feature. THIS 7700bt will not recognize Android Auto and it is not listed as an additional feature. Probably partially the reason it is so cheap.  I thought about returning it, but there is not a comparable deck that is available in US yet that supports Android Auto, AND is a fold out screen. Fold out screens are rare nowadays. In fact I bought the full double din version but returned it for this because of the modifications I would have had to make on my vehicle."

A warning for buyers, just because it looks like the old iPods doesn't mean it will navigate like one. To help everyone out the play button is long pressed can turn on/off the device, clicking left and right (not using touch and scroll like iPods) navigates the options, press the menu button to confirm a choice and press play to cancel or to return in a menu. The quality of recording on here is poor at best. I attended a convention and wanted to record what was being discussed. When I would press to start the recording it would take 5-15 seconds before it actually started to record. Don't bother changing to a higher quality recording option because it won't stick when you are ready to move it to your computer.

Very solid headphones that I've really grown to love. Very comfortable and I can wear these all day.<br /><br />🎥 Video review. 🎥<br /><br />Pros:<br />✅ Solid construction.<br />✅ Long battery life.<br />✅ Sound is okay.  There's a high-pitched 'squealing' every once in a while. (see video)  I think this is the bluetooth working, because when the bluetooth is off (and you're just listening to it through the 8mm cable) there's no squeal.<br />✅ Very soft, comfortable earphones.  Covers the ears completely which is a huge plus.<br />✅ Can talk on the phone with the them (note: audio quality is decent for a phone conversation.  I wouldn't use these for studio recording. See video.)<br />✅ Nice folks at Ausdom. They actually sent me these headphones to test and video review.<br />✅ Folds up compact and fits in my laptop bag beautifully.<br /><br />Cons:<br />🍅 Depending on what listing you're looking at, it's pricey for what you get (mainly the high-pitched squealing and fuzzy feedback you get when it's in bluetooth mode)... if you can find an Amazon listing of these for under $45 or $40, it's worth it.<br /><br />Summary: Very comfortable, look awesome, long battery life, and they fold up nicely."

After prompt email exchanges, I received  batteries (2 times, 2 emails 2 batteries) from different batches and both did not work. My Fluke test equipment told me I had 2 good batteries. My GPS worked best with no battery, including the original battery. Battery reviews say some batteries work for some 800 series GPS's.

This is a very well made case and I love BoxWave products, but I am just not sure what they were thinking on this design. The material was very nice and sturdy and so I am disappointed in this one.<br />The website did not clearly describe how this case works so I will tell you. Each time you want to set your device in view mode you have to &#34;pop&#34; it out of the two tabs on the bottom holder. They do not come out easily and so you can see the strain on the device when trying to set it up. I could also see that these two holders might easily breakdown. I LOVED the design of the BoxWave cover for the iPad3 that they made a few years ago. It was a simple snap-in folio design with a table to hold it closed. That was a perfect design.

I've used the speaker phone and both I and the person calling have been happy. Haven't actually measured how long the charge holds, but I've used it for days before plugging it in.

None yet.<br /><br />Like other reviewers say, this delivers  crystal clear audio with subtle distortions because that's what radio does sometimes. Usually distortions lastly only a few moments and don't happen overly frequently.<br /><br />The challenging part is finding a station that's open enough for this to sound good. I used radio-locator.com, it's a site that's literally designed to show you which stations should work best for equipment like this.<br /><br />I would recommend. It's a good little thing that will work for cheap until I can buy something more permanent."

The docking cradle is very helpful in keeping my phone upright and I like that my Huawei Ascend Mate 2 with silicone casing fits in the docking cradle.<br />- The sound quality of the speaker is nice and clear. No crackles or any interference and I like that the sound comes out on both sides of the speaker. This makes the sound more equalized and clear.<br />- The volume of the speaker depends on the volume setting on my phone. There are no volume setting for the speaker itself but it does amplify and make the sound louder compared to just using my phone's speaker.<br />- There is a switch at the back to turn the speaker on and off.<br />- Easy pairing which didn't require any codes. This also automatically pairs with my device after the first pairing just as long as the bluetooth of my device is turned on.<br />- light and easy to bring.<br />- USB cable charger included to charge the speaker. Fast charging time (less than 3 hours) with a red LED indicator which is on while charging and turns off when fully charged.<br />- There are rubber strips below to prevent the speaker from slipping.<br />- there is also a 3.5 mm cable included to be able to use the speaker on devices with no blue tooth capability.<br />- compatible on my devices: Huawei Ascend Mate 2, Moto G and iPad mini.<br /><br />* I received a free product to try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received."

Worked immediately. We are very happy with this purchase. Suggestions for fourth generation: Because jet pressure increases with input volume, not speaker volume, it would be a positive change to retain the speaker volume setting after power-down. The sound of the air hitting water is proportionate to that of real water-shows, but any reduction would be a plus. Thanks for creating this very entertaining product."

However, 4 stars vs. 5 because: 1) the receivers are a bit large to add to things like phones and checkbooks. 2) The sound from the receivers is not consistent between receivers (some loud, some not so loud), and if they're in another room, you really have to listen for them (this was during testing.

B00VJXLCKO,VicTsing Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter Radio Adapter Car Kit with Hands-Free Calling and Music Control,Mobile_Electronics,2,"I got this as a wireless blue tooth car device for my IPhone 6 plus.  It took several days just to see if it would work; it wouldn't pick up the cell phone signal at all during that time.  It does synchronize.  However, I don't see how this device is helpful for anything.<br /><br />I did eventually get the cell phone signal.  However, the cell phone must be 'touching' the blue tooth device for me to even hear a scratchy and poor signal from the cell phone.  That's not going to work.<br /><br />It is flimsy and detachable.  What good is talking on a device the size of lipstick that has rolled under the car seat?  (even if it worked properly)<br /><br />If the phone rings, you have to pick up the phone, answer it, turn your radio, and hold the cell phone down to the lipstick tuner device?  Wow, I should have learned that I need to spend the money on a real device.  I wasted thirty bucks."

Sure, the buttons were smashed and tilted, selecting an option can set it to record, and the colour changes every time you press a button which is more annoying than I thought, but the sound is great, can be set to random, all that stuff.<br />It took about 2 1/2 weeks to arrive, so be aware. Other than that, it's fine.

B00VU7PXDG,[New Element Series] iXCC MicroUSB cables,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Recently I received a set of two USB micro cables from iXCC. Each cable is 6 foot long. These extra long USB Micro cables are just what I needed for my Samsung Tab A 9.7 and Samsung Tab 4 8.0 tablets. I like to keep these near my bed and charge them at night. You see the original USB cables that came with my tablets were very short (about 32 inches or so) and I needed 6 foot cables.<br /><br />The two cables in this set are plenty long enough so I can keep my tablets charging while I am using them at night (reading in bed). And I also like the fact that these cables charge up my tablets so quickly!<br /><br />What I do is each night I charge my tablets with these cables and they charge as fast or faster than my original Samsung cables.<br /><br />Note that I use my original Samsung bases for this and just plug in these cables to the bases.<br /><br />This cable set was provided to me for testing and reviewing purposes. I promised to give it an unbiased review after I tested these cables. Personally, I found that these cables have exceeded my expectations and I am using them daily! Also, I will say that I tried other long USB cables and they were not high quality, these are of very high quality...I am very impressed with these cables!"

I have had no issues when charging my iPhone 6 with this USB to lightning cable from AmazonBasics.<br /><br />I also purchased a USB to Lightning cable from Anker and I prefer the look and size of that one over the AmazonBasics USB to Lightning cable. This is the only reason for a one star deduction. Both the AmazonBasics cable and the Anker cable work perfectly with the iPhone 6 and either one will get the job done. However, I do prefer the look of the Anker cable, and I would recommend the Anker cable over the AmazonBasics cable, as both are similarly priced."

One for my dad and one for my brother.<br /><br />My dad is VERY into good speakers, so I was a little worried. I have a Braven and a Jawbone. My friend has a Bose. I have to say, this one is better than the Braven and the Jawbone and as good or better than the Bose. Of course none of these wireless speakers are going to give you the base of a large speaker, but this one has great sound and projects sound very very well! I was very pleased!! The phone connects simply every time we use it."

B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"I have had other Bluetooth speakers before. They were pretty good. I thought I was listening to great sound until I received Sentey B-treck S8 Bluetooth Speaker! It has been simply amazing from the time opened it! The speaker comes with a USB cord for charging. It will need an adapter be plugged into a wall or just plug it into your computer. The AUX cord will allow you to plug your phone (also will plug in a laptop) into it. However, why use that when it has Bluetooth compatibility!?!? It comes with a nice black pouch to hold it. It fits snug in it with both cords.<br /><br />The speaker itself is high quality. It has a soft rubber feel which is unique. The speakers go all around it unlike the ones I've had in the past. It doesn't have any buttons to operate. The speaker is touch sensitive. There is a power switch on the back along with USB and AUX cords slots. What surprised me the most? The sound quality is unlike no other! It is ridiculously loud! When listening through wireless connection, it will blow you out of the room with the sound. It lets you know when you have reached top sound by a simple beep. The sound is crystal clear. You can call and receive phone calls from it,too. As always, you can skip or go back to any music while playing just a touch of the top touch sensitive key. They do have a slight delay, but it's not enough to worry over. This has been one of my favorite speakers from the beginning of tearing it out of the packaging after receiving it with a discount. It has made my music experience a lot better. I am going to be enjoying it with times to come!"

I was expecting these chargers to be very similar however the plastic around the part that plugs into the phone was much wider around, therefore not fitting into my waterproof Otterbox case. I would return them but it costs $6 to ship back, so I'm just saving them for my mother's phone. I do not recommend buying if your case requires a charger that is as small as the original Apple charger."

These are the best charging cords I have ever bought and they hold up to all the wear and tear put through by my family.  I have bought the 1Ft as well as the 3Ft and have even bought a pack of the 6 Ft.  The cords hold up better than the original charging cords that came with our iPhones in my opinion.  I will keep this link as a favorite and always go to buy for any charging cords.  I have sent this link to many of my friends and would suggest all my friends to use them.  The price is fantastic as well and very reasonable.

Suction cup portion works great, but mount length is too short & prevents Garmin GPS unit antenna from unfolding properly. I cut off the plastic mounting sphere from this mount & bonded (using JB Weld) the longer mounting length from the OEM mount.  This allows enough mount length for the GPS antenna for unfold properly.  It's not sleek looking, but it functions fine now.  Also, I  trimmed a little rubber surrounding the female connector on the 12V cord (at the GPS interface), to allow the female connector to seat flush with the mating male connector surface."

It's not very fancy, but it does work reliably.<br />  2. No power supply or remote battery. They must be added to the order.<br />  3. Silly light-show LEDs.  I had to open the case and pull the cable to turn them off.  What a silly waste of circuitry.<br />  4. No line-out or earphone jack.  This was a problem since I wanted to use some powered speakers already installed.  So I had to construct a couple of level-converting resistor bridges to connect them.  An earphone jack would add much more value to the amp than a light-show does.<br /><br />PROS:<br />  1.  Excellent technical specs. (see previous review by Richard Baty for this data)<br />  2.  Solid, tight, robust construction with minimal weight.<br />  3.  Good sound from both USB and SD readers, though the volume levels seem slightly different between them when the same files are played in a side-by-side comparison.<br />  4.  The remote works well.  Since the unit has few functions the remote is also simple, but complete.<br />  5.  Great value for the money.<br /><br />  This unit doesn't have all the features I want, but it does everything it claims to do very well.  That's good enough until I find something better."

Unfortunately, lately I have been hearing an annoying buzzing sound when I have it connected to my iphone via Bluetooth.  Also the volume level is a bit limited.  Even at the lowest volume I feel like I'm bothering my coworkers.  Last thing is that voice that comes on when you first try to connect the bluetooth.  It is a bit loud and distracting.  I use this speaker at work so I want to be able to listen to music with as little disturbance as possible!  Just bought this speaker a month ago and now I'm thinking I might have to get another Bluetooth for work before I drive my coworkers crazy."

B00LAG4F6S,iXCC Multi pack Lightning cable,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Short version: Perfect length for wall outlets, functions great. Probably a little long for use in a car. If you need one, buy two...<br /><br />Long version: There really is not much to say about a cable other than it worked, or it did not work. This one works. I purchased two of these cables for my daughter's use work an iPhone. To day the least, she's enamored of them. The length of a cable is an attribute that requires attention - especially considering how she uses her phone. This one hits the sweet spot between too long and too short. She can use her phone wherever without putting undue strain on the charging port, but it doesn't get tangled into a huge mess. If you're looking for a spare to use in a car, this could end up being a bit too long. Long cables in cars aren't always the best idea. However, for use with a wall outlet, it works perfectly.<br /><br />One more thought: I prefer not to leave five star ratings unless a product excels beyond my expectations. This one did and deserves the accolade."

I ordered it for my husband for his birthday because we didn't have one and it has been a lifesaver.<br /><br />My husband is one of those people that has to have something on to fall asleep to, be it the TV, radio, whatever.  I am NOT one of those people.  This has caused many a sleepless night for either him or me.  Enter this little speaker.  My husband now puts a movie on his tablet, puts this little speaker next to him so he can hear it and I can fall asleep in peace.  This wasn't what I thought we would use it for, but it's a total bonus.  He says he can hear his movies or YouTube videos perfectly and I honestly don't hear much of anything.<br /><br />He says the speaker sounds great, and if it didn't, believe me, he would say something because he's been a DJ for many years and will always complain if the sound isn't perfect.<br /><br />We like this one so much, I might pick up a second to use around the house."

I have a mac and it would eat the disc. No bueno..  They handed me their older laptop and I handed it to my husband who did all the man stuff he was supposed to do and hooked it up to his truck... I went inside and made lunch... (lol) I waited for him to come in and tell me stuff about it because I knew if I stood out there with him that he would either tell me man stuff or that I would be super bored...  He said he loved it and then left to go to to autozone, something about fuses? Then he said a bunch of other technical stuff that I have no idea about, don't know what it meant or even in what order to repeat it... BUt I did hear fuses and diagnostic and super cool a few times... He seemed happy so I would say yes...

B00CZEAF7C,HDE Music Portable Mini Speaker Stick w/ USB port & Micro SD Card Slot and Aux Cable,Mobile_Electronics,2,"I was hoping for tolerable sound from this using it as external speakers for an old mp3 player I had laying around, since I had just recently bought a one speaker NiZHi TT-029 cube mp3 player for about the same price and was pretty pleased with the sound from that other unit. The first issue with the HDE is that the sound cuts out every 20 to thirty seconds when using it as an external speaker using the provided jack. It seems just barely okay as an MP3 and quite poor as an FM radio. The audio fidelity and speaker tone are actually worse than the one speaker NiZHi, and the HDE unit only plays mp3 and cda files, not wmp files."

Here's why you'll see reviewers that complain about the display being too dim (unreadable in the bright light of day), like me, and others who either don't comment on that or don't find it a big problem.<br /><br />It's about the vertical viewing angle. If the mounting is sloped, so that the top of the faceplate tips away from your line of vision, (you're looking at it from a lower angle), you can't see the display in bright light. Period. And anti-glare measures won't help. If your view the display from a higher angle more or less perpendicular or a higher angle, it's easier to see (although still ridiculously dim for a modern device). So, take this into consideration if you're thinking of buying it.<br /><br />I'm going to be replacing it. Can't see the damn thing."

Great product and highly recommend it.<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. All views presented above are my own and in no way influenced by anyone else.<br /><br />Edit: Added a picture that I took right after taking these out of box, it looks purple but that's due to my lighting, the actual speakers are blue"

We installed it in my car, then took it for a ride.  We had no trouble at all, as you will see on the video.<br /><br />**IN THE BOX**<br />Dash Cam<br />USB power cable<br />Cigarette lighter charger cable.<br /><br />A few notes:<br /><br />PRO:<br />+ The method to fasten the camera to the windshield worked well, first time. It's a suction cup, that holds tightly.  It did not loosen at all during my drive/tests.<br />+ Longer, more helpful User Guide than I usually see. This one is much better written than most. Even the pictures in the manual are clear--that was a pleasant surprise!<br />+ Fairly easy to switch modes.<br />+ The output video quality was fine.  (I left it set a the wide setting, which is why you see the black bars on the video.)<br />+ Easy to start taking video, and easy to stop (just touch the \\""ok\\"" button.)<br />+ One year warranty, and the website URL is listed as the contact point.<br /><br />CON: (minor nits)<br />- The User Guide hints that the battery is only designed for brief, emergency operation; however, we had no trouble running it on the charged internal battery for quite a while.  The statement in the User Guide seems odd to me.<br />- Another statement in the User Guide seems incorrect. It suggests that the camera will automatically start taking video when external power applied; this was not the case, but perhaps I misunderstood the User Guide.<br /><br />√ All in all, a fun, easy to use Dash Cam. Just minor nit-picky negatives. We enjoyed trying this fun product, and I intend to use it in the future."

First off I had to hold down the play button and turn it to &#34;pairing mode&#34; every time I wanted to turn it on and connect it to my Samsung S5. Sometimes, I had to repeatedly press it as it would just stay off. A little over a month later, I went to connect it, and it connected, however it no longer streams any music audio from my cell phone through to my speakers. I can still receive phone calls and hear my friends but no music will be played on a music player or pandora. I went to settings and ensured that allowing audio to be played through it was checked. The device is no longer useful. Also, I found that sometimes it had lag and the songs would pause/skip a bit and that got really annoying fast."

The manual was written by someone who had no technical knowledge and spoke english as a third language. The drivers provided for communication to the radio would not open. They were archived as rar files. The cd had plenty of room why archive at all?<br />The software when opened all the fields are question marks(????). If the language is changed to english about 1/2 of the question marks change to english but there are still too many question marks  to be useful. Try to program by hand? only if you enjoy frustration and trying to figure what they are trying to tell you. Save your money and buy something from the big 3 japanese manufacturers.

B00M49C6MK,Sentey Ls 4162,Mobile_Electronics,5,"As a product tester and reviewer, I provide honest feedback to the consumers and companies I receive discounted items from.  If a product makes it this far, it means that it has passed.  If the product is not up to muster, we do not hesitate to contact the manufacturer.<br /><br />In this case we did contact Sentey.  We were having problems with the call back feature on my iPhone 4S.  Sentey responded to our email within 30 minutes on a Sunday afternoon.  After looking at the settings on my phone and cycling the speaker again, it worked.  I appreciate prompt service that they provided to us and would provide to other customers if needed.<br /><br />The speaker? I own a high end Bluetooth so I did a test run of how this would compare to both that and to a normal Mac computer speaker.  For its mid-range price point, I feel that this is a good little speaker for the value.  It of course doesn't have the depth and bass that a higher end model would have but, to be fair my high end speaker was well over $100. It was able to handle high bass songs at a medium range volume without crackling or becoming tinny.  It will stop the volume at a point when it could damage the speaker.<br /><br />The phone feature is good, has a slight lag and echo but not bad enough to warrant down grading this product's review.  I haven't found many Bluetooth external speakers that have outstanding sound.<br /><br />Fast charge, good battery life.  You will have to provide your own wall charger as this comes with a micro USB cable and a mini jack audio connector."

It’s essentially a thick and heavy duty plastic container and inside you’ll see rubber bumpers on the top and bottom of the speaker to protect it during shipping. You can see the speaker through the cover but there’s a bottom section under it that you can’t see where the accessories are.<br /><br />Once you get everything unpacked you’ll find the speaker, carabineer, user guide and two USB cable. One USB cable has a microUSB connection on the end to charge the AS100. The other USB cable has a 3.5mm audio jack on it, this is use dot connect non Bluetooth devices to the AS100.<br /><br />On the top is the control panel where you’ll see a phone icon along with arrows for skipping tracks and volume controls. The bottom button is for Bluetooth pairing mode and for play and pause. The center green button is the power button and for switching modes.<br /><br />One of the first things you’ll notice when you pick up the AS100 is the weight of it, it’s very heavy when compared to how small it is, it not look as heavy as it feel for sure.  The AS 100 is 2.95 inches x 4.13 inches x 4.13 inches and weighs about 12 ounces. It feels very solidly made and should be rugged and durable. The speaker itself is covered with a metal mesh screen to protect it and all around the casing are openings for the sound to come out, it offers a 360 degree sound field.<br /><br />On the side is a thick rubber tab that’s used for the included carabineer so you can hang it off your pack.<br /><br />Also on the side you’ll find the microSD slot as you can use the AS100 as a basic mp3 player and there’s also a reset button there in case something goes wrong.<br /><br />The microUSB slot is behind a rubber door to keep weather and dust out. The USB port is used for charging but it’s also used as an auxiliary audio input for use with non-Bluetooth devices.<br /><br />The bottom of the speaker just has some info and a rubber non-slip ring to keep the speaker where you put it. You can put it on the dashboard of your car and it should stay and not slide around for example.<br /><br />The first thing I did was charge the AS100 with the included USB cable, simple to do just plug it into your computers USB port and let it charge. The LED on the top lights up red to let you know it’s charging. There is no battery level indicator to let you know the charge level, but it seemed to have a charge already as it didn’t take long for charging to complete, maybe an hour.<br /><br />The included carabineer just clips into the rubber tab on the side of the AS100 and it should hold the speaker well as the tab seems durable. This is great for just hanging it off of your pack while your hiking and having some traveling music for the trip.<br /><br />When powered on and ready to be used the LED lights up blue and blinks for pairing mode and it has audible tones.<br /><br />Usage:<br />For Bluetooth testing I used the Arespark AS100 with my PS Vita and HTC One M7 Android phone.<br /><br />It paired with no issues to both devices, quickly and easily.<br /><br />The controls on the AS100 worked correctly to control the music on my phone, I could play and pause and skip tracks and of course you can also use it as a speakerphone.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br /><br />The sound quality is very good, yes it’s not stereo sound but it still sound very good. I played several different types of music and all were clear and sounds very good.<br /><br />Using it with the PS Vita really enhanced the gameplay, the enhanced bass really added to the gameplay.<br /><br />One of the first things you’ll notice about this speaker is that it can get very loud, I was truly surprised by the volume that comes from this little speaker. It’s just amazing that such a small speaker can produce so much volume.<br /><br />There are noticeable highs and lows and the sound is clear except for very high volume where it does get slightly distorted, but this is the way of most all small speakers like these.<br /><br />There is a lot of bass that comes out of this little speaker, I could feel the vibrations through my desk actually, and there is little to no distortion at high volumes with the heavy bass.<br /><br />I guess I have to clarify that as I seem to have contradicted myself there is those to sentences. What I mean is that at max volume there is slight distortion, but the bass isn’t the reason for the distortion. Lots of little speakers like this will get distorted from the heavy bass itself, but this one really doesn’t. It’s more of the combination of the everything where the distortion comes in at max volume. You can play bass heavy music and it will be clear, unlike some speakers where the heavy bass is the cause of the distortion. I hope that clears things up.<br /><br />MP3 Player:<br /><br />One of the bonus features about the AS100 is the ability to be a stand alone mp3 player thanks to the microSD slot.<br /><br />Yes it’s a very basic player, no display or anything like that but you can play and pause and skip tracks.<br /><br />I loaded up some songs on a microSD card and popped it in and it recognized it and worked just fine.<br /><br />Since there is no way to tell or search for what music is on the card, the best thing to do would be to just put the songs you want on the card so you know what’s there.<br /><br />It does work fine as an mp3 player and I think it’s nice option to have, you can load it up and just go and have your music and not  worry about pairing Bluetooth or anything like that.<br /><br />In my time I’ve owned and reviewed a lot of Bluetooth speakers and most are just that, a speaker and that’s it. The Arespark AS100 goes one step further to even add more value and functionality by letting you use a microSD card so you can use it as a basic MP3 player.<br /><br />The unit itself is very well made, it seems durable and rugged and the actual speaker inside is very well protected so you can toss it around, toss it in your bag and it should be safe from damage.<br /><br />For what it is I like it very much, and I can easily recommend it if you’re in the market for something like this, it’s well worth the cost in my opinion.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Very well made<br />+Decent battery life<br />+Decent sound<br />+Simple to use<br />+3.5mm auxiliary cable included<br />+Mp3 player via microSD<br />+Very loud<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Very slight distortion at max volume<br /><br />**I received this product for review for free in exchange for my unbiased review***volume where it does get slightly distorted, but this is the way of most all small speakers like these.<br /><br />There is a lot of bass that comes out of this little speaker, I could feel the vibrations through my desk actually, and there is little to no distortion at high volumes with the heavy bass.<br /><br />I guess I have to clarify that as I seem to have contradicted myself there is those to sentences.

Came with everything you need, ready to use out of the box. Power cable long enough to run in a full size pickup from power socket in center of dash to under the drivers side dash and up along and across the windshield to the rear view mirror with plenty to spare If anything negative to say, with the extra wide lens you won't be able to read license plates unless they are very close to you. However, the good thing about the extra wide lens you can see everything to the far left and right when reviewing the video. I don't drive much at night, but in the city with plenty streetlights it works fine for me. I think the daylight video is very good. Only used the menu settings once in the very beginning and have never had to use the menu again. Set up was easy with the English instructions.

It connects super fast to the phone and it charges quickly. On full charge it lasted me 9.5 hours. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the box said it contains a black speaker, but I received a pink one. Which I don't mind as I do like pink.

For a dashcam, it's great. It does what it is supposed to do. But the extra features that I bought this particular model for, well, I disabled them because they are so buggy. First to be disabled was the 'parking' mode that is supposed to detect motion and start recording. I have no idea what keeps triggering recording, but it was basically recording all the time until the battery was dead. Looking at the recordings, I don't see any motion. And I tried parking in all different areas. It will go off and on for several hours until the battery dies. Maybe clouds in the sky? Who knows? There is no sensitivity adjustment, so I just turned it off.. Next to go was the FCWS Forward Collision Warning System. First off, you can only enable it in 10MPH increments ABOVE 60mph. So the only place I could test it was on the turnpike. False alerts all over the place. Ongoing traffic triggered it. Traffic WAY ahead of me triggered it. At night it was even worse. I gave it a couple of tries hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Disabled. Next to go was the LDWS Lane Departure Warning System. It was pretty accurate, but it was still false alerting at least once an hour when I used it. Got to be too annoying, so I disabled it as well. First I just tried turning off the audible alerts, then turned off the function completely as it became too distracting with so many false alerts. There is no sensitivity adjustment at all for these features like there is for the G Sensor. If you are looking for a good dashcam, this one is okay. But if you want this one for the features that make this a 220 model, I'd wait until they've fixed these features. I am hoping for a firmware update, but as of now, I wouldn't pay the extra for this one. Buy the 200 model instead and save yourself some dough. UPDATE - The SD Card Slot just quick working today. Came out to my car today and the SD card was ejected. Triedpushing back in, but the spring is broke. Won't stay, keeps ejecting. Barely over 5 weeks old. Now I gotta send back to Transcend for a repair. PIECE OF JUNK."

They are well built and will not disappoint if you are looking for this type of setup.  Mine are ported and sound great.  Big bass, small package!  Would buy again and again and again!"

B00WVTHNPI,BeoPlay A2 Black Copper,Mobile_Electronics,5,"The Beoplay A2 speaker provides excellent sound, looks lovely, and is pretty much everything I was hoping it would be. The sound is plenty loud and to my ears remains clear and snappy all the way up to maximum volume. It is not cheap, but neither are its competitors, and while I didn't perform rigorous comparison testing, it performed better (in some cases substantially) than the similar products I listened to, and is in my opinion the prettiest choice by a fair margin.  I think most people will be very pleased with it.  Reading other reviews, I have determined who will not be satisfied with this product. The largest unsatisfied constituency will be people who don't understand how batteries (and energy in general) work. If you play it at maximum volume, it will not last very long. Just like if you floor it in your Tesla and never let up on the pedal, you will not achieve the driving time or distance that Mr. Musk says you will.  Moreover, it is a small portable speaker, so if you totally want a bumping party far away from power sources, out in a desolate open field somewhere, you will probably not find it powerful or long-lasting enough for you and your amped-up buddies.  In sum, if you don't expect the A2 to be a replacement for a full-fledged plugged-in stereo system, and assuming you are willing to spend money on something this superfluous, this speaker should make you very happy."

I had a nice cheap mp3 player that after five years of dropping it finally gave out, so I was looking for something similar. I looked at this thing and though that this would be a good alternative. Even after sorting all of my music into nice neat folders it didn't acknowledge the folders and it just sorted all my songs alphabetically. Also if you want to listen to music and look for a another song you can kiss that goodbye because the minute you look for another song to play the music stops playing.

I am using it as a router and WIFI hot spot. It is truly a &#34;wireless router&#34; since it  has one WAN port and only two LAN Ethernet ports. I use one of the Ethernet ports for a networked terabyte backup drive and everything else is wireless. Someone reported in the reviews that they had problems trying to use the Ethernet ports in this configuration. I suspect it was a defective unit or improperly configured since I had no problem at all. Although advertised as a quick setup, it took me a while longer to get the hang of it. The touch screen configuration panel is all that is needed to get the job done, however after the install was complete I logged on to the router and found that is has a number of configuration options that are not available on the touchscreen. I should mention that this guy seems significantly faster than the router it replaced that was configured in exactly the same way....two computers, two printers and the terabyte drive....probably just better technology since the other router was several years old...."

Though I am using if for my phone it can pretty much hold anything that will fit and the strong magnetic grip between the base and the mount definitely have its advantages and make this a great product.  That being said, it does not help that the mount will not hold a phone in the upright position (at least not my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active), other than that this product is sleek and does not distract your view when not in use thus a great purchase.

Double tapping it invokes REDIAL of the last number called - be very careful with this one, especially with streaming services where you might not be sure it’s playing or buffering so you hit play twice, ‘brrrrringggg’ yeah.<br />• Pressing the track forward/next button causes a strange bluetooth induced ‘skipping’ of the first few seconds of any song/audio, like it’ll cut in about 2 seconds after the beginning of the song, and then jump to about 5 seconds in, it’s very noticeable and only happens when you press it’s buttons (doing next/previous on your phone doesn’t make that happen) this is mostly just oddly annoying but means it’s low quality.<br /><br />The device is so gorgeous and very ergonomic, I hate that it has these flaws, if they were to fix these, it’d be the best. but for now, it’s just ok.s very noticeable and only happens when you press it’s buttons (doing next/previous on your phone doesn’t make that happen) this is mostly just oddly annoying but means it’s low quality.<br /><br />The device is so gorgeous and very ergonomic, I hate that it has these flaws, if they were to fix these, it’d be the best. but for now, it’s just ok."

The mount that comes with this camera is a little shaky, so I cut one of my GoPro mount extensions and bonded it to the Ausdom so I could use my GoPro clip and it is very secure now with no shaking.  I really like how this camera turns on when I start the car and turns off when I shut the car off. It also monitors the car as it is parked, waiting for an impact - and you can adjust the sensitivity of this feature as well.<br /><br />The lane monitoring feature only works when the HDR recording is turned off - the calibration of this feature actually disappears from the menu when HDR is enabled, so If you are missing the land monitoring, turn off HDR.<br /><br />Customer support is outstanding.  I have had many questions and they promptly respond to them, including less than a day turn around time for a software bug fix.<br /><br />The software, once you locate it, is nice.  It shows you on a map with your speed and location.  I am having trouble with the software displaying my current speed, but their very helpful customer support is working with me on the issue.<br /><br />Night recording is great as well.  It would not work very well if the area was poorly lit, but your vehicle's headlights are more than enough to make the video good at night.<br /><br />If the software worked perfectly and the other small issues were worked out, this would have received 5 stars."

B009S99IYI,PIO TSG1644R 6.5 in. G-Series 2-Way 250W Car Audio Speakers,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I bought two sets of these for a cooler radio build. Pushing them with a Pioneer headunit, I would say the 40w RMS rating is a bit overrated. They are very crisp sounding, but they lack when it comes to bass. I've had two different headunits (Dual and the Pionneer) and both had about the same SQ, but the pioneer has more adjustments. I gave 4 stars for the crisp tweeters, 2 for the bass. They're good looking as well which was important for me since they were going in a cooler."

Direction on the Internet for the Voyager indicate that there are two wires that need to be connected. My second friend figured it out that the hot red wire went to the unit and the black one was the ground.  Installation was a breeze with pearing  and it was less than 1/3 of the cost of a Voyager."

B00S4ACESE,Lenko Dual 110V AC outlets and Dual USB 3.1A 500w power inverter car dc 12v to 110v ac inverter dc adapter laptop charger notebook adapter usb charger,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I've used several similar-size inverters for various applications.  Some of these have been noisy because the fan operates continuously, so I wanted to try one that had a thermostatically controlled fan.  The fan works as advertised.  I have tested this unit up to its rated 500 watt output, and initially the fan doesn't operate at all.  Then as the inverter warms up, the fan speed gradually increases its speed.  Even at full speed the fan is noticeably quieter than two other inverters of similar size that I have.<br /><br />Good points: 1.) Will operate up to its rated output of 500 watts; 2.) It's quieter than similar inverters I'm familiar with; 3.) Has a positive acting ON-OFF switch rather than a push-on/push off button.<br /><br />(I have not yet had the opportunity to test it when it is continuously under a heavy load over a long period of time.)<br /><br />Description error: There is only a single power outlet and a single USB port, not &#34;dual&#34; as stated in the description.<br /><br />The only possible negative at this point is the single outlet is made to accommodate several different types of plugs.  A standard USA 115 volt 3-prong plug fits well enough, but time will tell if it will hold up in service--it looks very different from what is found in other USA appliances and the initial fit of a plug seems slightly loose."

I occasionally regret getting it for her but am thinking of getting MYSELF one."
B00UKP35WA,MOXO X-1 Levitating Bluetooth Speaker,Mobile_Electronics,4,"The people who give this bad reviews either don't know how to use it, or expect some kind of amazing surround sound quality. First of all, the base has to be plugged in for it to levitate at all. The red lights of the base will guide you to the correct placement. to turn it on you hold down the power button (there are only 2 buttons, so trial and error, right?) To sync it with a device you would hold down the button that is not the power button until it beeps or something, then you can sync it to your device of choice. The sound quality is what you would expect from a portable speaker, because at the end of the day, this IS A PORTABLE SPEAKER. Do not expect some kind of amazing sound. This is the type of item you buy because it looks cool. That's why I got it. A levitating orb with red lights is a head turner. The fact that it can also play music is a plus.One more thing, if you watch videos on it with your phone, there may be a slight audio sync issue."

The software was up to date, the cable looked and felt solid. Tested on both my laptops win7 and win8.1 64 bit, Light was on, connected to my 2014 Highlander with no problem.. So I went ahead and buy the SEED number, passcode to reset my immobilizer. For those who do not know, this is a required step to register a USED smart key to the Toyota and main reason I bought the cable. In the last step of the operation, the 16 minute wait screen came up and suddenly disappeared, instead  a &#34;Lost Connection to Vehicle&#34; screen appeared. In other words, I just lost my token ($). I never suspected the cable, thinking TSI software problem, my 64 bit windows laptops.or anything else but the cable .After several fails and lost tokens , I finally found the problem, the MVCI cable. The cable appeared to be working since it connected to my vehicle and can do health check. But in some operation, like tire pressure data, it failed. After several tests, the cable was the culprit. I was so disappointed."

Tried it with 3V (two AA batteries) and it makes a spark about 5mm (1/4in). Pretty loud crackle too. Comes in a plastic bag - no instructions! but none are really needed. The red/white wire pair is the low voltage side (the red wire is +). The other two red wires have a slightly better insulation and are the high voltage pair. Not much else to say about it other than to stress that this is a High-Voltage device which can deliver a nasty jolt if used improperly - so due caution is required when using it."

B00JVIPVZ6,SODIAL(R) Waterproof Underwater 4GB WMA MP3 Player Swimming Water,Mobile_Electronics,1,"Broke during playing 1st song.  Downloaded 25 songs with ease all while charging the unit, but it stopped playing the 1st song, not even submerged 6 inches (great sound for the 2 mins it played), then I noticed the USB wouldn't connect.  The port where the USB & headphones connects moves downward into the unit when either are plugged in, making for a loose connection, & it doesn't actually connect when you plug them in.  It is an internal elctronic problem.  I am returning now.  Update:  The seller promptly asked me if I would accept a $15 refund and told me I did not need to return the item.  Since the headphones are still usable & I intend to purchase a $45 player with a 4 star review average out of almost 300 reviews, I accepted the almost $5 dollars less refund than I paid."

B00YD1VDIU,Perchmount Fit Magnetic WOD Smart Phone Mount,Mobile_Electronics,4,"I tend to be skeptical of one size fits all claims, especially since cell phones vary so much in size. I was pleasantly surprised to find this held both my LG G2 with a case, as well as my wife's Samsung Galaxy S5 mini securely. The magnet is very powerful, and the included adapter uses a 3M adhesive to mount a metal ring to your dashboard or the non-magnetic surface of your choice. The design allows for easy placement and will rotate in place. The only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is there's no practical way to tilt the base, to adjust the elevation. Other than that it's a great unit, and I highly recommend it if you need a foolproof mount for your phone.<br />I received a demo unit at no charge in exchange for an unbiased review."

Pausing the song and then turning it back, makes it work for another minute, and that's it, it's like there is a buffer and it fills up very quickly and then the device is unable to keep up. I am not sure it is a faulty device, or a faulty line (model). Aux works great though, but using the cable only is not what this speaker was bought for.<br />And by the way, the device had some dings, even if new in the box (box was undamaged), I think it came from manufacturing."

I purchased this product solely because of protection while parking so that someone hit my car and try to run away, by looking at its parking mode feature and more reliable name value than other third parties. Guess what? IT DIDN'T work exactly when I NEEDED IT to be working!!! Before purchasing this one, I already had someone dented my door and just ran away, so I was exclusively and desperately looking for dash cams with parking modes. One day I parked at nearby Walmart with dash cam looking at front, and when I came back, IT WAS HIT BY SOMEONE HARD up to the extent that the parking mode might have been caught it. BUT NO, the parking mode was TURNED OFF, although I SWEAR to God that I turned it on the first time I installed it on my car, since that feature is what I've been looking for, right? BUT NO. It was turned OFF. Later on, I looked up on their homepage and found an update file, of which an update note says: May 19, 2015 V1.06<br />2) Recall changes made to the settings in the parking mode before shutdown. AREN'T THEY SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT WORK PROPERLY IF THEY ARE SELLING THE PRODUCT AND ADVERTISE FOR SUCH FEATURE?! Anyways, manufacturers were cunning enough to deny all possibility of ANY OBLIGATION by putting disclaimer on their homepage, so only thing for powerless customers like me can do is to put the review<br />for voice of protest."

Sound is not muddy either.  Bass is balanced, and may not satisfy those who demand an over-abundance of it.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is this:  If you are multi-tasking while listening, out working in the yard, partying outside the house or out in a public place, you will not notice any flaws in the sound quality.<br /><br />This speaker sounds great with the volume cranked up high.  Sound is clear at very high volume and does not break.  Bass is middling--not excessive.<br /><br />Unit itself is nicely constructed, no flaws, all ports and control buttons identified and easy to access and control.  This unit can take bumps and bangs because it is covered in quality rubbery plastic. It has nice gripper pads, too, so it stays where you put it.<br /><br />*I received a free product from Eachine."

It has a good on/off switch that's easy to work, no pushing of a rubberised button that doesn't get pushed half the time. It also has a slot for a Micro SD card with MP3's on it so you could load your own music, a nice touch. It's a pretty speaker, and doesn't sound half bad, doesn't go real loud, charges with Micro USB cable (yea), and has a cool &#34;large rubber band&#34; like carrying strap. EVERYTHING that I've bought so far from Lumsing has a quality feel to it. Sounds best if backed up a few inches from a wall or something for the sound coming out of the back to bounce off of. / After playing with this speaker for a few days let me say I'm more impressed with it. The sound has gotten better with use. Some speakers seem to do this, as least to my ears. And it's a bit louder than I thought. It will fill a room that is not noisy. It has a nice clear, clean sound. The kind I like. But if you are a bass lover, this isn't your speaker. I still haven't tried puttting some songs on a Micro SD card and trying that yet, but plan to. The only think I didn't really like about this speaker is the &#34;stickers&#34; that they used for on the raised feet. Nothing bad to say about this, but I can't see them lasting very long. But over all, I'm much more impressed with this speaker. I see why it always gets good reviews. I like it, and I have almost a dozen Blue Tooth speakers."

Amazon is using those huge air pillows that work great and break down real small for easy disposal. I didn't even need the manual to pair it!

B00M49C6MK,Sentey Ls 4162,Mobile_Electronics,5,"It is a well built speaker.  I have primarily used it to play music.  The sound is balanced.  The bass is a bit low to what many would desire, but it is still within an acceptable range.  No distorted (high mids or trebles) sound.  I haven't had the opportunity to use the mic on it, but I really do like knowing the feature is available.  I also do appreciate the Line Out feature.  It would be pretty interesting to Daisy chain several of them and envelope a room."

B00PK4DGO8,"Aukey MUSE Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker, 10 Hour Playtime, Dual 5W Driver, Enhanced Bass, Full, High-Def. Sound, Built in Mic, 3.5mm AUX Port (SK-M2, Silver)",Mobile_Electronics,3,"I was amazed by the build quality of this speaker.  The only problem its the Bluetooth.  As many others have pointed out, there is a problem with it since it starts stuttering.  Now, to be fair this is what I found so far:  It seems that Android Bluetooth in lollipop by itself have a problem. (Just search on Google), but I also found that there must be an engineering problem in the design of the speaker since it has metal all around it. (Notice that many Bluetooth non-problematic devices are mostly plastic).<br /><br />So, I purchased two to corroborate my findings. (of course, when on sale for $19.99 with code).<br />This its what I found when using it on many of my devices:<br />- On HP Slate 21 - 4.4.2 ... it works fine but it has to be no longer than 3 feet from the device.<br />- On Nexus 5.1.1 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Galaxy Note 3 - 5.0 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Acer Iconia - 4.1.2 It works fine<br />- On Acer Memopad - 5.0 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Nexus 7 - 5.1 - stutters until it stops working<br /><br />(Please notice the Android version for the ones that work fine)<br /><br />So, since I purchase them at such low price point, I got OKRA BTR1 Bluetooth receiver for $12 and connect then via the AUX and all devices connect fine.<br /><br />Please note:  The quality of the item is great and so its the sound.  The only annoying things are the Bluetooth issue (which I think its a hardware and software issue; and the strange voice when powering it on or pairing the device or connecting the AUX.  Otherwise, IMHO I think the device its good and hope that its mostly a lollipop compatibility issue that will be resolved in the near future by Google."

Wrote to blackvue support in Korea twice, absolutely zero response. Taking it apart, there is a supercap Vina Technology Hy-Cap 5.4V 7.5F (two 2.7V 15F caps in series i think, which are wrapped), plus one tiny rechargable battery which had zero voltage. Replaced tiny rechargeable battery (which sometimes worked from reading forums), didn't do anything, now only wifi light turns on. The Supercaps are expensive, about $25 each, so haven't tried replacing them yet. But as I said, looks like I'd need to reflash it using jtag. If it works, I'll write an update."

But every gas station in the US has AAA batteries.<br /><br />I love the SD card for expanding storage.  I can throw an audio book on a card and am good to go.<br /><br />The controls are easy to use and can be navigated without even looking at it.<br /><br />I wear mine on a lanyard, so the little groove in the back is great for just this.<br /><br />Battery lasts hours on end, and when one dies, I pitch it, cram a new one in there, and the player remembers exactly where it was when the battery died.<br /><br />Then to top it all off, they are inexpensive.  If I break or lose it, it's a bummer, but I am out the cost of a meal, not a car payment"

Still works fine.<br /><br />That makes this one true outdoor speaker. Big volume, good audio with bass response, and a great IPx6 rating, one step below being actually submersible. Has a couple unique aspects to the battery design:<br /><br />1) Point to clarify - the battery capacity is 7000mAh, but batteries have a general conversion percentage of 70%, meaning you get 70% of the juice back that you put in.  At 5200mAh, that is 74% conversion.  In other words, the battery capacity is 7000mAh as it would be labeled on anything else, just the manufacturer not only declares the realistic amount, but also has an above average efficiency.  Can also double as a external battery charger for mobile devices, and it's own output is rated at a whopping 2.6 amps. Tap the red button on the side to switch to Output, as well as lighting up the battery life meter.<br /><br />2) Instead of having two ports, one for In, and one for Out, it only has one USB Type A port - so yes, it charges via USB to USB (and not Micro or Mini). Has a super long included flat USB/USB cord along with a super long flat 3.5mm Aux cord.<br /><br />- Discounted price offered for evaluation purposes"

The audio level and quality is excellent. The construction inside and out is not quite U.S. commercial grade, but it's much better than typical consumer grade, especially at this price point.  The cast aluminum body and silicon rubber seal in the MIC were pleasant surprises. The power cord is a minor exception, it could have slightly better wire and lighter plug. Rockbirds was prompt and professional when I submitted some questions, I just wish they also sold the cable so I wouldn't have to wait for shipping from China.<br /><br />I bought mine mostly for APRS packet and Radio Direction Finding using Doppler, so I was disappointed there was no External Speaker jack. The existing jack is just for programming per the Juentai web site.  After checking inside, I found simply adding a 1\\"" jumper could put Receive Audio on the MIC jack, and if you're willing to drill a hole (voiding warranty, I'm sure) you can easily add an External Speaker jack.  Watch out for the CALL button, you could easily end up transmitting when you don't expect/want to (not good for the Doppler).  I believe a menu setting can turn this feature off.<br /><br />If you want more info on the mods, search for my call sign at youtube or radioference dot com.<br />73, Gary N8RDF"

Popular enough for me to get a second set later on - yet this one is FAR superior.<br /><br />+ Bluetooth, AUX In, or micro SD for MP3 playing - the far left button on the front is the \\""mode\\"" switch between them.<br /><br />+ Rechargeable battery, or leave it plugged into a power source.<br /><br />+ Circular water jets with a centerpiece gives a dynamic display.<br /><br />+ Jet height and timing follow both rhythm, tempo, and the volume.<br /><br />+ 360 degree audio presence (the DEs has a forward facing speaker).<br /><br />- No instructions, though one really doesn't need them.  However, there was initially mysterious third setting on the rear power toggle, but it is a mystery no longer.  It's to play music without the jets going (although that printed icon doesn't make sense).<br /><br />- It is only a single speaker, whereas the DE set is a pair of \\""dancing water\\"" towers.

B00YS1NRHK,Yuanj® Portable Bluetooth Speaker 4000mah Speaker Power Bank Stand All-in-one Device Mini Sound Box Portable Speaker External Charger Music Player Powerbank for Iphone Ipad Samsung Galaxy HTC Android Phone Smartphone Tablet Pc Bluetooth Speaker (Blue),Mobile_Electronics,4,"This unit is a combination external battery charger and speaker, and it has nice potential. I was initially VERY frustrated by the poor instructions included in the retail box... specifically, there is no information in the guide on how to charge the internal 4000mAh battery. The instructions need a total redo, and once we figured out how to use this device we liked it.<br /><br />Battery function<br /><br />After unpacking the device, find the supplied multi-cable kept in the area under the tray inside of the box. This cable has a standard male USB on one end that splits into two pigtail ends; one pigtail is a male micro-USB and the other a male 3.5mm AUX.<br /><br />Plug the standard USB end into your favorite charging device (wall charger, USB charging station, laptop USB port, etc...), we used our Samsung wall charger, and then pull the end-cap off of the battery/speaker unit to (1) turn the unit on and (2) access the unit's ports.<br /><br />Once the end-cap is pulled off, plug the cable's 3.5mm Aux pigtail end into the corresponding port on the battery. There seem to be two 3.5mm Aux ports on the end of the battery, but one is just a dummy and the other is real. The active one is not marked, but you will be able to tell when you pick the proper one as the device's LED light will light up and a voice may say 'Bluetooth' or 'Aux connect'... the voice seems to randomly say things from time-to-time. If you stick the 3.5mm Aux jack into the dummy hole, nothing happens at all.<br /><br />The unit has three small LED lights that inform you of the remaining charge in the battery; upon initial connection, one light was lit signifying that the unit may have been up to 33% precharged by the factory. Over the next six or seven hours, the battery progressed to full charge... which seems like a fairly long time give out 2.1A charger's output. Further reading indicated why; the input flow rate of this unit is just 0.8A max, regardless of the power source's capability. That's fairly slow and even at that rate we did feel a little heat built up near the connection end as charging was going on.<br /><br />Once charged, using the battery was not difficult; using either the supplied cable or the cable that come with your device (recommended), just connect your device to the battery's USB port and charge your device as needed. The storage capacity of this battery is 4000mAh which is good for a charge and another partial boost, but not for multiple charges without recharging.<br /><br />The charging times we experienced were about what we get from 1A wall chargers... on average, a rate of about 1/3 percent per minute, which equates to about 1% every 2.5 to three minutes or about 20% - 25% per hour. The batteries in our phones are 2200 mAh and 2400mAh in capacity, so this makes sense given the battery's 1A rated output.<br /><br />Speaker function<br /><br />For its size, the speaker actually punches out decent sounds; it is fairly convenient and portable at 4 7/8 inches long, 1.25 inches (roughly) in diameter and about 4.8 ounces per our postal scale. The backup battery & speaker combo unit is an easy carry in your purse, jacket pocket or back-pack.<br /><br />The specifications in the paltry user guide notes that the speaker was \\""ZW\\"" of power... assume they meant 2W, and it puts out good volume for the small size.<br /><br />You can crank it up fairly loud without significant distortion, and when laid flat on a solid foundation like a counter or table  top, it provides decent bass, and good mid and treble. There are no controls (volume, next track, skip, etc...) available on the unit itself, so all of the control must come from your sending device. Not a problem for us, and the speaker actually responded well to the equalizer application on my phone.<br /><br />You can send music to this device by Bluetooth or by direct wire view the 3.5mm port (same port you used to charge the battery...)<br /><br />Bluetooth<br /><br />Pulling the battery/speaker's end-cap off and then putting it back into place is what is needed in order to activate the speaker's Bluetooth search (blue LED light flashes). Pairing with my phone was quick and trouble-free, and we found the range to be good -- better than many other similar devices we have tested.<br /><br />Typically the phone paired with the speaker was within three to 12 feet of the speaker, with relatively good line of sight between the two devices. The BT sound production is not bad at all and, as mentioned, it responded nicely to my equalizer app.<br /><br />3.5mm Aux<br /><br />This unit's speaker also plays nicely through 3.5mm Aux connection, and it offers an interesting feature; the end-cap has two male 3.5mm Aux connectors built into it, and they can be used in this process. All you do is plug one in to the 3.5mm headphone port of your sending device (like my HTC Droid DNA) and the other into the active 3.5mm Aux port on the unit.<br /><br />The sound produced by the 3.5mm Aux cable connection is really not bad at all, and by situating the connection from the back-side of your sending device, the battery becomes a lengthwise stand.  This works very well, especially when we decided to watch a Netflix movie on my phone.<br /><br />The opportunity here is that not all transmission devices are configured in a way that the end-cap can be used to make the 3.5mm Aux connection... we have an older MP3 player that is just too thick. It would have been nice if the manufacturer had included a 3.5mm Aux cable with male jacks on both ends, but then we do have several of those already and they worked fine with this speaker too. The Amazon listing's \\""Package Contents\\"" section does not that the unit includes \\""1xThe 3.5 mm audio line\\"", but we did not receive a separate 3.5mm cable... just the portion attached to the single multi-cable included with the unit.<br /><br />Sorry about the length of this review... just turned out that way. Many ins & outs, pluses and minuses...<br /><br />No mention of a warranty that we could find, so if an issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this device gratis from the seller and have put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a combination 4000mAh power bank, 2W speaker & stand of this size, style, price and capacity, for use as I have described above, then we would recommend giving this unit a try based on our experience with it. Just have a little patience, and all will be fine<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.speaker's end-cap off and then putting it back into place is what is needed in order to activate the speaker's Bluetooth search (blue LED light flashes).

I would like to suggest the child was foreign and learned English from a translation handbook. For example: black wire is red = negative 12 volts (total nonsense).  Having said that, like most, perhaps all basic cameras, there are 2 wires: one for 12 volts of power (red) and one for ground (black).  There are even 2 options for supplying the power: one at the receiver end of the cable and another at the camera end.  The color saturation of this low cost camera is pretty impressive."

I enlarged the tiny instruction slip to six full pages so that I could see the fine print and ambiguous illustrations. The functions of the buttons are not obvious from the markings, it takes the picture to figure out what they are supposed to do, like the back arrow to change to miles per hour...<br /><br />Update:<br />I was able to test the HUD on a BMW 323i. The speed and tachometer worked, also the instantaneous fuel flow and temperature. Later, the HUD failed to display any data on a Chevrolet Avalanche."

B00RDCMYAW,Bluetooth Shower Speaker – SoundPal Water Resistant Wireless and Hands-free Speaker with Suction Cup - Compatible with All Bluetooth Devices,Mobile_Electronics,4,"The sound is fine but not as great as i was expecting from the reviews. Things can get a little tinny when you have the volume up too high but since I just want it to be loud enough to hear over the shower it is fine. As far as it being too quiet, I think the trick is knowing how to turn the volume up, since it isn't obvious from just looking at the buttons. To turn the volume up and down you have to press and hold the skip forward and backward buttons. The default volume is quite quiet so you do need to turn it up to hear over the shower. I love being able to control my music while i'm in the shower."
B00MFM89XQ,"Lumsing&reg; Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with NFC Built-in Microphone, Powerful Sound Rechargeable Battery up to 1 Day Playtime",Mobile_Electronics,5,"Bought this on sale, so for the price, size, and weight the sound and functionality is very good.  Main complaint is really that when in Bluetooth mode, it's hard to tell what's going on when the + and - buttons are pressed -- a long press will adjust volume, while a short press will change tracks. However, this means it's hard to make small volume adjustments since you have to hold onto the button but there's no way to tell how much the volume has gone up, until it actually does (quite quickly).  The Chinese accented English announcing the different connection modes is ... amusing, but does not detract from overall functionality.  Edit: another mild complaint: if you're using the line-in mode and turn the power off and on, you have to unplug the audio cable and plug it in again for it to detect it.  Still not a deal breaker though, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the speaker."

B00XJJU4SC,Juentai JT-6188 Dual Band VHF/UHF 136-174/400-480MHz VHF 25Watt UHF 20Watts Dual Band Two Way Radios Mobile Transceiver Walkie Talkie,Mobile_Electronics,2,"This radio has some good potential, but under the current firmware level it is barely usable.<br />Manual programming is similar to the Baofengs where the offset is ignored and one has to store the TX and the RX frequencies on the same channel. In the end, it can be done, even assigning channel names manually, but it is cumbersome.<br />Computer programming can be done using ANY Serial (or USB serial emulation) to 3.5mm stereo pin cable. The programming SW does not accept copy and paste, and the radio is not CHIRP compatible, as of the date of my review. If you run Windows XP, you need to worry only with the normal Prolific driver limitations. If you run WIN 7, you will need to fix the MSCOMCTL.OCX driver. After that, the SW will work on Windows 7.<br />The main issues I have with the radio are listed below:<br /><br />1) Humming noise when volume is all the way down, even when using a signal clean battery as power source,<br />2) Loss of audio when the encoder is used to switch from/to an active channel<br />3) The loud beep sounds when the scan function finds an active channel (instead of playing the audio),<br />4) The RX interference it suffers when the vehicle is in motion and the radio is fed from the cigarette lighter cord that came with it.<br />5) The high cost to return it to China (around US$50), even if the unit is defective. Not Amazon nor the dealer seem to be willing to pick up the tab.<br /><br />Therefore, in a $99 radio I would need to spend about 50% of its value to return it. This situation basically forces me to keep the radio and use it with all limitations described, or as paper weight.<br /><br />I have seem other owners stating they do not hear the humming noise I described, and that is part of the &#34;hit or miss&#34; quality of my unit, but the main issues are firmware dependent. In a radio that has no capability to have its firmware upgraded, the only way to see a fix is to wait for 2 or 3 new firmware cycles and then purchase it at thattime. Your mileage may vary, but I am disappointed."

There are ways to stealth it up a bit with electrical tape and other options.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Functions wonderfully<br />Great image and video quality<br />Great parking mode and G shock sensor<br /><br />Cons:<br />Too flashy with the chrome, orange and labeling<br />Large size (but it has a great LCD screen so this is acceptable if you want a touch LCD on your unit)<br /><br />In short if you want a great dual dashcam setup it is hard to beat the functionality of this unit. The new firmware updates have fixed a vast majority of any bugs. You do need to buy the lexaar brand memory cards to avoid issues though. It also requires two memory cards. one for the front cam and one for the back.<br /><br />Happy Dashcaming"

It's not like it's a Beats Pill, but if you just want something that doesn't cost hundreds of dollars, you just something for a bit more volume, this is a good choice."
B008RV3DEY,New Uncut Blank Transponder Ignition Key for Toyota Avalon Camry Corolla Rav4 Tundra Yaris Matrix Solara (Chip #4d-67),Mobile_Electronics,5,"Programmed on the first try.  Used with 2009 Sienna and 2004 Solara. Same program sequence. Dealer cut the keys for free using VIN #. Tip: program them first, then cut - easier to return if it doesn't work.<br /><br />Program sequence I used:<br /><br />Get in car and shut the door. (All doors should be shut)<br />Insert a working key into the ignition/remove 4 times.  On the 5th time, leave it in. (Don't turn the key)<br />Open/shut driver's door 6 times.<br />Take working key out, insert blank into ignition. (Don't turn the key)<br />Let the blank key sit in the ignition until flashing security light goes out. (About 90 seconds)<br />Remove blank, insert working key, start car to end program session.<br />You know your blank key works when inserting it makes the security light stop flashing."

You will hear music like no other, I recommend a JX360 JL 4 channel door speaker amp for this.  It makes mine pop if you turn it up all the way so it is a perfect fit for it and pretty cheap.  Tweeters are decent actually, I turn them down.  The only caveat with crossovers that are fixed, is obviously no adjustment can be made, these are fixed to 100 hz.  Which actually works very well considering my subwoofers handle from 18-100 hz, but if my subs were lower response I would have some missing frequencies in my music.  However most crossovers I've seen are all fixed around there, just something to be aware of."

B001ASNTZO,National Products Ram Marine Fishing Rod Holder System,Mobile_Electronics,1,"I previously used Ram Mount Rod Holders in my 2004 Lund Fisherman, when I bought it new...  They were the best rod holders I ever saw, they were the bomb!!!!!.  I used on my previous boat, a close facsimiles to &#34;Fish On&#34; brand rod holders, that did not last, and eventually paying the extra money to have the Fish On brand on my 90' Sylvan.  They were great!  When I bought this boat in 2004, the boat dealer told me that these Ram Rod Holders were heads and shoulders above the others, and that the extra money was well spent...  It was!  The Ram Rod Holders were all that he said they were.  The versatility of these rod holders was far and away a complete departure from the norm.<br /><br />In May I purchased a new 2015 Lund Pro-V, and the boat dealer, did not know about this type of rod holder.  So I decided to purchase these and install them myself.<br /><br />What you see in this picture that shows the product, was what I had in my last boat.  All aluminum component, covered with a rubberized compound.  Durably built to last the life of the boat.  What they sent out to me was NOT WHAT&#34;S PICTURED HERE!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />What I got was plastic, and that this picture was supplied by the manufacturer for their product to the vendors (Amazon).<br /><br />Now I first had this sent to me by Cabelas in April, and I was furious that I got something that didn't look at all like the ad pic!  So I called Cabelas up and sent back these rod holders, and told them about the inaccuracy of the pic.  They refunded my money, and I saw the same pic on Amazon's ad, and thought this time I'd get the right rod holder...  I DIDN&#34;T!!!!!<br /><br />In the meantime, Cabelas investigation found for me that I was indeed correct, and that the rod holder I wanted was no longer available, yet this pic is still used!<br /><br />I have all Ram Mount equipment on my boat for my rod holders and my GPS/Depth Finders, too.  I'm a huge fan of their products.  However, this deceptive picture is causing me to re-think that Ram is all that I had known them to be...  I am furious that this pic still is used to describe this product visually.  YOU WILL NOT GET THIS ROD HOLDER. AS THEY NO LONGER MANUFACTURE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />When you have the best product on the market, and a picture is worth a thousand words, and these rod holders are not inexpensive, WHY WOULD YOU MISLEAD YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS?????!!!!!<br /><br />I'm in the process of attaching these rod holders to my Lund Sport Track, I had to have the bracket apparatus manufactured by a welding shop.  As the Sport Track system has no brackets that allow for top mount, only side mounts, and that defeats the whole purpose of having this versatile product...  So if your considering this product to be incorporated into a Sport Track System, you need to know this fact.  I had a piece of 1/8&#34; aluminum made into a 2 1/2&#34; by 2 1/2&#34; right angle, that will allow me to place the Ram Mount Ball on the top of the gunwale.  So be aware!<br /><br />In the end, the sad truth is that they are probably still the best product out there, and I have to learn to live with this fact.  With that said, I am entirely upset with Ram as they are misleading loyal patrons like myself,  with these knowingly false representations of their product.  I look forward to seeing their Patten run out and better customer oriented companies that see the wisdom to make these products as they were originally designed available to the public.<br /><br />I have no idea how this product will perform or last!  Perhaps it will perform as well as the other product will, but my expectation when I opened the box was not met, and nor will yours!!!!!<br /><br />See Photo attached for what you will get, and the Aluminum Angle Metal that I had made for the Sport Track.  I will cut them into 3 1/2&#34; lengths, and attach them to the Lund Sport Track Side Mounts.<br /><br />Good Luck!e is causing me to re-think that Ram is all that I had known them to be...

B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"This review is for the Sentey S8 portable Bluetooth speaker.<br /><br />First off let me say I have both the S4 which is the smaller version of the speaker and the S8 which is the version being reviewed and sold on this page. The S8 is quite a bit larger than the S4 but offers much better sound Quality and has the ability to play much louder. This speaker is easy to connect to using the Wi-Fi on your phone or tablet or any other device capable outputting Bluetooth. The speaker is Bluetooth version 4.0 but it is fully backwards compatible with earlier versions. Bluetooth range is stated at 33 foot and I found the speaker to work exceptionally well and it times have exceeded 33 foot and the speaker still played fine. This speaker also has a built-in microphone for hands-free functionality for making phone calls conference calls and such. It comes with a nice carrying pouch in the box which was a nice surprise because I didn't see it in the original Ad.<br /><br />I used a decibel meter on my phone to measure the sound level and it hovered at about 96 dB and the app stated that that was between the average food blender and subway system. If you've ever been around of food blender I can assure you this is quite loud.<br /><br />I found battery life to be quite long, But it is a little slow to recharge. You charge this with a micro USB cable which is the standard charging system on any Samsung phone and most Bluetooth appliances. A charge cable is included in the box."

B00MFM8AUI,"Lumsing&reg; Portable NFC Bluetooth Speaker,Rechargeable Battery Powerful Sound Bass System for iPhone iPad MP3 Player Smartphones Laptop",Mobile_Electronics,3,"I already had a bluetooth speaker that I liked, but the battery on it was getting a little questionable, and the recharging light wasn't ever going off, so when I saw on LifeHacker that there was a promo code (at the time) to drop the price down to $10, I tried ordering two, but found out that it only works on one product (should have known). It's not a terrible speaker.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Decent look<br />-Gets really loud<br />-The voice of &#34;Mamma&#34; from the Ubisoft game series narrates the features on this device<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Sound quality isn't great, yeah it gets loud, but there is an odd emptiness to the sound, can't explain it, it is far from bad. For me there is way too much bass and not enough treble. For the price it's very good.<br />-Build quality (I guess for the price is fine) isn't great and the back subwoofer is installed crookedly, doubt that messes with sound quality too much, but you get what you paid for. Also the rubber strap still had some excess material that didn't get sheared off, not terrible. It really isn't terrible.<br />- The rubber feet on uneven surface is ever so slightly wobbly. Also they don't really make contact with a flat surface since there is a weird bulge in between them where the speaker bumps out on the bottom. You can tell that it's a normal build thing for aesthetics.So the feet are kind of useless (even with the plastic removed), but they do feel grippy if they were to be functional.<br />-So pressing the &#34;+&#34; skips the song, but you have to hold down &#34;+&#34; to turn up the volume, kind of backwards thinking there.<br />-The NFC is really hit or miss, but it is definitely there, so there is that.<br /><br />Is this going to replace a more expensive speaker, no, but for the money, it's pretty good. Too much bass, but some people like that, my music is more treble than bass so I don't love that feature."

I love that when a speaker talks to me like that. Well after using this speaker for a while, it has decided to speak an Asian language. We all get a big kick out of it. We have no clue what it says, but it has a happy voice and talks really loud. My guess - it is saying Power On, Bluetooth ready to pair, and Bluetooth paired.<br /><br />Everybody can laugh at this because this speaker actually sounds great. The design is excellent - I've seen it with some other really good Bluetooth speakers. This is a two speaker sealed acoustic design with a passive bass speaker in the bottom. For a small speaker with a good amount of amplifier power - this is the best design possible. The two speakers are roughly 1 inch Mylar cones with long through and flexible surrounds.<br /><br />I liked the speakers a lot. The bass was solid, it plays to a good high volume, and the mid-range and highs are clear. No it isn't audiophile great, but you never expected that. At this price point, this is a really good speaker. My son is so critical of small speakers - he used this for an evening while playing Call of Duty and said, hey dad, those are good speakers. He's also a guitarist - so he kind of knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />The speaker is rugged. Super rugged. The case is covered in that soft satin rubbery material. The grill is metal with a pretty geometric pattern in it. Thank goodness there is a real live power switch - not one of those stupid multi-function buttons. The speaker charges via an included microUSB cable. You provide the AC adapter, computer port, or powerbank battery. There is a slot for a MicroSD card - enjoy using that. And there is an Aux cable input.<br /><br />The top controls are really sweet. When you get near them they light up blue - a really cool blue. The phone button is play, pause, and answer the phone. The two buttons that look like speakers are tricky to use - short press moves the track. Long press changes the volume. When you reach max volume the speaker plays a goofy tone. This takes some getting used to. The buttons are touch sensitive, so you don't have to press anything.<br /><br />If you don't mind being yelled at in an Asian language every time you turn this on, you will be rewarded with a really great sounding speaker.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for review.When you reach max volume the speaker plays a goofy tone.

Yes, I'm talking about the Mini Bluetooth Speaker from our friends at Arespark! They're a new company to us, myself and many of us. For first impressions, they have blown us away and I'm more than happy to share with you my experience!<br /><br />The Good: Arespark has provided us the opportunity to test their Mini Bluetooth Speaker that is as simple as can be. Starting with the ability to connect to it via Bluetooth (with my iPhone 5S) or insert your Micro SD Card to play music from it. It doesn't feature a 3.5 mm audio jack-in port which isn't deal-breaker at all. We live in the day of age that wireless is the norm. During playback, I didn't experience any &#34;hiccups&#34; within the audio as it was streaming from my device to the speaker. Nor, did I experience any issues as it was streaming from my Micro SD Card. It impressed me and others greatly with its crisp audio, fantastic bass and clever treble.<br /><br />This speaker was stated to play up to about 7 hours and it did just that. I took this puppy every where that I travel if I didn't take any headphones along for the trip. It would be clipped to my bag as I longboarded Downtown, back home or simply throughout the city limits. Plus, I found that the best volume to play audio/music at is around 75% - 85%, so you won't experience any cringing of any sorts. There are other features built into this speaker, such as a built-in microphone for you to answer and make calls if you wish. Plus, a built-in FM radio with a LED display clock and support for Micro SD Cards and TF Cards.<br /><br />  &#62; Power On/Off Button<br />  &#62; Volume Up/Skip Forward Button<br />  &#62; Volume Down/Skip Back Button<br />  &#62; Bluetooth/Play/Pause Button<br />  &#62; Answer/Deny Call Button<br /><br />The Bad: I didn't really find any horrible things about the Mini Bluetooth Speaker, but there a few things to point out. There isn't an audio-in jack if you're searching for one and recommended volume is about 85%. Otherwise, it's a great accessory for the road!<br /><br />The Experience: Personally, it's one of my favorite bluetooth speakers that I have reviewed this year so far. The fact that it's small, durable, crisp and bass-heavy (vis device settings) has made earned a THUMBS UP from me.

B00YHLCG64,Beltronics Pro GX65 Radar Detector (Black) (Certified Refurbished),Mobile_Electronics,5,"I was a long distance, 48 state driver and I needed a detector to monitor my heavy foot. I bought this at a truckstop 10 years ago and I've never had a single problem with it other than leaving it too long in the hot desert sun of Arizona. It will go blank like a GPS does until you cool it off. I have had my detector go off on KA band (usually hwy patrol) from a distance of a mile and a half behind me! That's right, in the cab of a semi with a loaded trailer in the desert! Up to three miles ahead I start getting intermittent beeps and a full on alert about one and a half to two miles. It has never failed to notify me even when there were &#34;pop-up&#34; style radar cops! It would detect either the &#34;bleed off&#34; from the detector or when it was being turned on for another vehicle. I don't promote speeding but when you have a full load of frozen veggies that need to be delivered asap and you have been doing 75 across AZ, Nv, or even 80 in Utah and suddenly you are slowed down to 55 across the Mojave Desert, you tend to get drowsy. So I didn't slow less than 65 at any time. It speaks for itself."

I liked the specs and it was on sale at the time so I decided to purchase it despite my misapprehensions. I am a prime member so I got it delivered in 2 days. Packaging was really good; speaker came in a plastic casing which was secured in plastic wrapping and was placed in a neat box with bubble wrap. Was easy enough to open and came undamaged. Speaker is easy to pair with a Bluetooth device; didn't need to look at the instructions. It had some life in it so didn't charge before use. It came with the USB cord to charge, a cord that can be used to connect in a speaker port (like where the headset part of your phone is) and a little green clip. Tested quality with Bruno Mars' &#34;Uptown Funk&#34; and the output was quite satisfactory. Good bass. Only thing that can be termed a negative is that the bass causes the speaker to slide across surface like tables. If its on some form of fabric its fine, no shifting. Being on fabric doesn't muffle the sound in any way. The sound is quite powerful in a large room once there are no other devices competing. Its plays clear for Sam Smith songs as well. I had my cousin call my phone while it was connected to the speaker playing a song. The music was interrupted to ring for the phone. I answered the call with the little call button on the speaker. There is a like a fraction of a second delay between speech from the caller and what is heard through the speaker. This isn't a flaw in my opinion. When the caller comes close to the speaker a high-pitched feedback is heard by the caller. Again not a flaw in my opinion, why would someone who's calling you be right next to you! So far I am very satisfied with the little speaker and would reccommed it to others."

B00MJCDPM2,Sentey LS-4460 B-Trek S8 Bluetooth Portable Stereo Speaker (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,"It seems so small in the picture but I received it and I say wow! First of all it comes packaged very neatly and would be very presentable as a nice gift for someone. Inside the box, you will find the speaker itself, an auxiliary cord, a USB charger cord, and even a drawstring travel carry bag. The function buttons on top are very large and would be great for even an older person who has trouble seeing smaller buttons. The buttons are smooth on the top of the speaker so you don't have to worry about breaking any thing on it. On the back you will find both the auxiliary port, charger cord port, and on/off switch. To charge the speaker you simply attach the supplied cord to your USB port on your computer. It takes a couple of hours to fully charge but then runs for about eight hours on one charge which is pretty impressive. To pair it to your device, just turn the switch on the speaker to on and go to your bluetooth settings on your device and select the speaker. Once it is paired you can play your music directly to the speaker and if you pair it to your phone. Great product"

B00RFMRWW0,"Blusmart Car Fm Bluetooth Radio Transmitter, Hands-free Calls",Mobile_Electronics,3,"This unit worked great for about a week. I'm bummed to leave a negative review, because I was really stoked with it for that first week! I used it to port sound to the stereo of an older collectors car with an original stereo that I didn't want to rip out or modify. When it worked the sound was clear and it was easy to use. I liked that the head came off for security when you weren't there.  However, after the first week it started acting up. It would turn on for 20 seconds and then die for 5 minutes, then again on for 20 seconds and then die. I'm not sure if it was a loose connection at the magnetic base, or faulty wiring, but regardless of the cuase, mine has become un-usable.  It hurts that much more because of how much I loved it when it worked. Was such a slick way to port surf tunes to my '72 collector car!  Updated July 5 2015 The seller has issued a refund for the broken FM transmitter, citing quality control issues. In the meantime I had purchased a competitive device, so while I can't strongly recommend this product based on my experience, the company's customer service was fair."

B005AF5XOI,George Foreman GR10B Grill Champ Non Stick Coating 2 Fixed,Mobile_Electronics,5,"I've had a several variations on the small George Foreman grills. I have literally worn most of them out, and they last when cared for! I use my GF a LOT. They are great when making a meal in the summer. It doesn't noticeably heat the room like the broiler in my oven and I think it uses much less power all year round. They are just the right size for one or two people.<br /><br />I cooked steak, lamb, pork, chicken, salmon, tuna, cod, haddock, bluefish, trout, and a bunch of stuff that just isn't coming immediately to mind. It was all great. The biggest danger is over-cooking because it's so fast and cooks from both sides at once.<br /><br />When cooking for one and there is space behind a steak or pork chop, I put slices of veggies like bell pepper and onions back there to cook with the steak. Behind the steak is a steamy spot on the grill and these veggies cook to perfection in the same time as the steak. Sometimes I rub them with olive oil for a nice taste.<br /><br />The tilted design is great to get rid of grease and the hot plates sear the surface to seal in juices and flavor. With fish I like to use a very light coating of Mayo which seems to help make pink and white fish even more detectibly moist and tasty. With steak and meats the grill works great with rubs and spices. I really like the Paul Prudome &#34;magic&#34; line of spices. Yum! Even cooking a whole trout is great, albeit I needed to slice it in two at the ribs so it all fit at once. About 6 minutes between the plates and done to yummy perfection.<br /><br />If you freeze steaks, a 6 oz 3/4&#34; thick steak frozen solid and dropped on the hot places will be done to medium in just about 10 minutes, in my experience steak cold out of the fridge of the same size/thickness is done to medium in about 5 to 6 minutes. The timing is just about second nature now.<br /><br />The non-stick surface isn't perfect, though pretty good. Be careful with forks/knives and use a plastic spatula to remove fish as it has a greater tendency to stick than anything else.<br /><br />Cleanup is oh so easy. While one must not put their little GF in the dishwasher or immerse it (I wish the plates were removable!) it's still pretty easy to clean.<br /><br />First, just after the food comes off I give it a quick hot wipe with a paper towel to get the bulk off. Just takes a second to do this. After the meal I finish the clean-up by hanging the front of the GF over the sink and using a soapy wet sponge. I thoroughly wash the plates and clean the catch tray. Then I use the clean catch tray to rinse the plates of soap, then drain it and both air dry. Water all flows into the sink and it's really clean. It all takes a minute or two.<br /><br />This is a great tool. If it wasn't so great why would I keep buying them? :-) I even keep a spare on the shelf in case my current 4 year old one fails. I love my GF and its saved so much of my time while giving me great food to enjoy. Fabulous!s a greater tendency to stick than anything else.<br /><br />Cleanup is oh so easy.

B00YD1VDIU,Perchmount Fit Magnetic WOD Smart Phone Mount,Mobile_Electronics,5,"This thing is pretty handy.  First of all I have an iPhone 5 as does my girlfriend so I wasn't able to test it out on other size phones but other reviews seem to indicate that it works on phones of varying sizes.  The magnet is really strong and keeps your phone secure and level even when gravity is working against it.  I have a metal rack behind my desk at work and stuck this sucker on the side and the magnetic grip was so strong that detaching the Perchmount from the rack knocked over stuff on my rack.  In other words - the magnet is strong.<br /><br />Lots of uses for this - while cooking, exercising and really just anything where you need your phone stable while recording video, reading something, or doing a Facetime call.  There's also an adhesive base that comes with it and you could use this to create a mounting spot on your dash so you can use your phone as a GPS - SOOO much better than those suction things that never work.  So there's a multitude of uses here.<br /><br />Great handy little item.  The next time you need a steady phone or your hands free you'll wish you had it.<br /><br />Full disclosure - I received this product free of charge."

B00F2GMUPU,E-PRANCE® Mini 0801 Car DVR Dash Camera Ambarella A2S60 Chip 5M pixel CMOS + GPS Logger + High Resolution Full HD 1080P 30 FPS + G-sensor + License Plate + 135 Degree Wide Angle View,Mobile_Electronics,1,"Revised feedback 2/2017:  all these style of cameras have a cheap internal battery that fail extremely early and make saving your video file when you shutdown your car questionable.  Additionally I have issues now when trying to protect (lock) a video recording (when pushing the down arrow,) camera then the shows an error, then freezes and turns off when connected to the car power.  Memory card is brand new class 10, and this same problem persists now matter what sd card is used.  Avoid and get newer technology.   If you are in the market for a 0801 dash cam be sure to get a branded one such as the E-PRANCE and not a generic/no brand 0801 camera for several reasons:  First, the generic/no brand 0801s firmware in my experience did not have a mph option and if you think you can just upgrade the firmware to fix this, good luck finding a compatible upgradeable firmware for a generic unit.  The wrong firmware could render the unit dead and from what I briefly read requires you to create a custom usb cable to flash it back from the dead.  Secondly, the generic no brand 0801s have a different plastic male mounting pedestal thickness on the camera vs the branded Eprance/Ojocam 0801s so you can't use a generic 0801 camera on the ojocam/eprance bases (gps or no gps doesnt matter).  The E-prance and Ojo 0801 cameras are interchangeable with their respective bases with gps working on either camera from either model base.  The difference since I have both the ojocam and the E-prance is that the E-prance mounting base is tighter fitting with no rocking of the camera once inserted which is a huge improvement over the ojocam 0801 I also have.  The only other difference I found is the ojocam firmware was customized with their splash screens for their company.  The menu fonts are the same and menu options I have found so far look to be the same.  The E-prance unit I ordered had the latest firmware from April 2015 from E-prance so you know you are getting the most up to date interfaceand options.  Audio recording could be better but all these 0801 units have this weak point.  The audio quality can sound pretty rough if you have the radio volume turned up.  The Video quality is great and span of view is wider than you may think, it covers almost a 180degree view from left to right.  Additionally, you can set it to record automatically upon start up and shuts down with no user intervention.  The user interface on all these units is a little tricky at first but read the manual and you will get the hang of it.  Unit can get warm/hot if in the sun and while running but has never shut down on me. Using a 16 gig Class 6 Samsung micro sd card with no issues.  These e-prance units are at a good price point at $77 with prime shipping, recommended."

B00E1BRITU,"Pioneer Class FD 4-Channel Bridgeable Amplifier w/1,200 Watts Max Power, Model GM-D8604",Mobile_Electronics,2,"Just installed an hour or two ago, very good, strong, clean power. No whine or static in any channels. Have it powering Rockford Fosgate Punch 6.5 components in the front and Polk (can't remember, just random  Polks (50RMS handling) as placeholders until I upgrade to Hertz) and they sound crystal clear/ more powerful than my Polk 660.4(75RMSx4) that just died on me a few days ago (which is more expensive and puts out less power). This being my first class D speaker amplifier, I cannot tell the difference between the class AB and D myths as the Polk was AB, maybe it's just a better quality amp or what but this sounds much better than the Polk as well as my Alpine M300 in my other car ( but the alpine does only put out 50 RMSx4). Much easier to dial it in gain wise to match my head units 5 volt pre-amp voltage (Pioneer 80PRS head unit) than the Polk as well. Amps I've looked at in comparison  were Soundstream Picasso series, Soundstream Tarantula, a few MB Quartz, Rockford Fosgate Prime 600d, Punch/Power series. All in all, I'm glad I went with this amp but I'm hoping I don't end up having the one channel dying on me issue that some have had.<br /><br />***Update as of 04/23/16***<br /><br />As of this date, for the past 2/3 months my front left channel has been cutting out, as I drive and make turns the speaker and tweeter will cut out continuously. Took apart my door and tweeter and all connections are sound. Unfortunately I'm going to bite the bullet and just buy a $300+ amp that puts out 100rms/speaker because it's frustrating having everything give out after so long with no abuse."

B00QERR5CY,iXCC Multi pack Lightning cable,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Our household is dominated by iDevices. It seems we are always losing cables or they die after only a few months use. We've been through plenty of (overpriced) Apple brand cords as well as Amazon Basics, and Anker cables. I trust all three brands but in each case their cables just don't withstand the test of time, and are too darn expensive. For years I've been searching for a product that strikes a perfect balance and I think I just might have found it with iXCC.<br /><br />So far these off brand cables are the best yet, and at a very attractive price. The cables are thin, but not flimsy. The connectors are on the smaller side so I think this model would be perfect for those who have problems with tight fitting cases where others don't fit.<br /><br />After two months use we are so far very happy, I'll be sure to update should there be issues."

B00VJXLCKO,VicTsing Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter Radio Adapter Car Kit with Hands-Free Calling and Music Control,Mobile_Electronics,5,"Excellent little sucker, but I have only used the BT to Car-Speaker feature.  I got stuck with setting it up initially for BT operations with car speakers, but once I had it going, I really love it.  It has just enough controls to not be intrusive.  Manufacturer can do a slightly better job with the instructions though!  UPDATE:  After my very good review, unfortunately just today (21 days after I received the unit), the back button on mine seems to have quit - as a result my rating has gone from 5-Stars to 3-Stars.  The forward button is working fine.  I don't know what the problem is but I hope VicTsing is reading this.  I was actually planning to purchase another set for my daughter.  Hopefully this is a minor problem - I am on travel and may not have a chance to return it on time for replacement.  UPDATE 2 - 7/13/15: On July 1, VicTsing emailed me about my comment and frankly were sorry I had issues with the product.  On July 2, they emailed me again that a replacement was on the way and that I did not have to return the bad one.  The package arrived on July 6th but I'm on travel and have not been able to open the box yet.  I'm sure it will work fine.  The product is really good and I give it 5 stars."

I own all three &#34;sizes&#34; of Bluetooth speaker from the Sentey line and while there is a difference (as you would expect, the larger and the more expensive, the better they sound) I think this is the perfect mid-range in both size and sound quality. This one has more base than the smaller version but not as much boom as the largest. The craftsmanship is flawless and it charges quickly and the battery lasts a long time. The phone feature is a little on the static side but that could have more to do with my cell phone than the speaker. It's honestly not a feature I plan to use. Overall, I'd purchase this again in a heartbeat. Great speaker!"

In the past my phone was in airborne when trying to find my phone when late night calls came. Now I put it in this holder and stick it on to a metal object. I won't be asking - &#34; Where did I put the phone?&#34; anymore. Phones are bigger these days and you need it handy. I would recommend indeed!

B00YD1VDIU,Perchmount Fit Magnetic WOD Smart Phone Mount,Mobile_Electronics,3,"I received this product free of charge from a voucher code in exchange for a review.<br /><br />This crescent magnet thing is pretty cool. I have a big phone (who doesn't nowadays? The smallest one is a friggin regular iPhone 6). With the weight of my phone and the case, the magnet still holds it up. I followed some of the examples the product comes with and put it on the side of my microwave and refrigerator, as well as on a door and under the table because why not. You have to get creative with the position of the phone inside of the holder or it balances out on its side or slides down because...you know...physics  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br /><br />I like it in my car a lot. The magnet that it rests on comes with a 3M tape sticker thing, and you know 3M is not messing around. It sticks pretty well and I live in a place where the temperature gets above 100 degrees and tape can be questionable.  I use it to hold my phone and use it as a dashcam because it's always been a dream of mine to be as Russian as possible.<br /><br />So the standalone magnet with the 3M tape is strong, but the drawback is the circular magnet on the actual crescent itself. After about 5 hours of moving it around and placing it different places (I'm dedicated) the magnet on the crescent actually came out. The glue is all still attached to the magnet itself (should've used 3M tape on each piece). It fits back in and doesn't slide around or anything but it could get looser and make the product obsolete."

The important features to me a microSD card slot, playing time length and Bluetooth.  Unfortunately my car can do phone Bluetooth but will not do music playing.  I received the device and ran a flash drive test which ran for 2.5 hours and charged the player.  The memory test passed. I then took a 16GB card with 1545 songs and plugged it in.  It recognized the card.  I had to choose all songs and pick the card folder; then create the list before it would play.  I also set it to shuffle mode and let it play connected to regular speakers via 3.5mm port.  Tried to set one of the predefined equalizers but found that the volume got lower so left it off.  After charging my Bluetooth speaker I then try to pair the player.  Opened the Bluetooth function.  Turned on the speaker and then search for the device.  It took a couple of times but eventually I was able to find the BT Speakers and pair the devices.  Then the card gave me a disk error. Turned off the player and tried again.  This time it was easier to do the pairing.  Then when choosing the music had to create the play list again which took about 45 seconds.  Chose a song and it starting playing through the Bluetooth speakers.  From my BT Speakers was able to pause and play the current song.  Also was able to forward to the next song and replay the previous song with the BT Speaker controls. The directions were in English but in a tiny font.  I received the player, ear phones, a charger/data cable, instruction booklet and protective pouch.  Looking at the youtube videos help with understanding the button functions."

B00W3FYFDI,E-PRANCE EP503 FULL HD 23041296P Car Camera Recorder 170 Degree Wide Angle Lens WDR Night Version G-Sensor HDMI,Mobile_Electronics,5,"[[VIDEOID:6a5ad156e86f938b2ac90c3ef34248e1]]The E-PRANCE EP503 dash cam compares very favorably with other dash cams that I've used. As a dash cam and DVR, it's a excellent piece of equipment with a very good wide angle camera and microphone, and it has several potentially very useful auxiliary features. Setup was relatively easy, and the user guide was better written than most of the ones that I've seen for dash cams.<br /><br />The camera has a lot of settings to customize its operation, but except for the date and time, you could use the default settings right out of the box. For testing purposes, to keep the file sizes down, I set the resolution at 1280x720/30fps (the highest resolution is 2304x1296/30fps, and there is an available 1920x1080/60fps), with image quality set to \\""Fine.\\"" Before using the dash cam for the first time, I inserted the included 16 GB Class 6 micro-SDHC card for recording. Make sure the device is connected to the vehicle's power outlet before recording begins, since the dash cam's built-in battery has a very limited capacity.<br /><br />One of the menu settings is \\""Beep.\\"" I recommend that you turn this off first, since it's annoying to hear the beep every time you choose a menu item. The settings include some specialized features like motion detection, parking monitor, G-sensor, and LDWS/FCWS (Lane Departure Warning System/Frontal Collision Warning System). I did try the LDWS, although I didn't try tweaking it very much. With the default setting, it worked, but not consistently, and the beeping got to be annoying when I was changing lanes intentionally. Frankly, I don't think the LDWS/FCWS features are going to work very well in a system where an add-on dash cam is the only sensor. In vehicles that have LDWS and FCWS capabilities built-in, I believe the systems are more sophisticated than just a single camera. It's not a failing of this dash cam, since I've found the same clunkiness in other dash cams that I've used.<br /><br />The dash cam also features an HDMI port with an included HDMI cable for viewing the video files on a TV or monitor that's equipped with an HDMI port. Note that if you do this, you'll need to power the dash cam from a USB port, since the device's own small battery will only power it for a few minutes.<br /><br />If the G-sensor feature is turned on in the settings, the sensor determines if the car has crashed, in which case the last file is locked so it can't be erased by loop recording. Needless to say, I'm not planning to test this feature.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very capable dash cam/DVR that will give you an excellent HD video record of your driving.<br /><br />The dash cam was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.port with an included HDMI cable for viewing the video files on a TV or monitor that's equipped with an HDMI port.

The problems are really with the buttons.  There are a number of them but they try to do to much.  You have to figure out how to manipulate the buttons to hook up to the phone and run the device.  Even the volume is a pain.  One could argue to just figure it out but like most of us I should of just got the cheap one with FM for the shower.

Make sure you get a good adapter with a fuse and you probably want to avoid the cheap ones from the local auto parts store.  Also, I soldered this adapter on and used heat shrink tubing to avoid getting a short or broken wire down the road.  I would have much preferred paying an additional 3 dollars to have this already attached.  Anyone who wanted to do a permanent install could just cut off the adapter.<br /><br />Once installed, it works pretty good, but about every 10th time or so I hook my iPhone 5S up to it the audio doesn't work right and just makes a very loud &#34;digital static&#34; noise and I have to unplug the phone and replug it back in.<br /><br />In my opinion, the audio actually sounds better through this than out mini-jack on the iPhone.

B009CRMABY,ZHOL® NEW Am-fm Hidden Windshield Antenna Car Radio Truck,Mobile_Electronics,5,"My '07 JK Unlimited NEVER had good reception; but I FINALLY got around to fixing it recently. I pulled the center dash panel (good instructions can be found all over the forum), and popped the radio first to check all the connections. After disconnecting and cleaning all the connections I found that the performance was the same - local stations were not receiving in stereo, distant stations were buried in static, and seek didn't find much - even among my presets. With some consideration - I tried isolating the radio, by grounding it with a harness directly to a frame connection in the forward cabin firewall - but this didn't have much (if any effect).  I decided to try removing and cleaning the antenna. Along the way I traced the wire and verified no critters had been snacking on it and that it was making a good connection throughout - well, I lost the chase as it passed through the firewall, but it was good that far, and I took the rest on faith. I removed, cleaned, lightly sanded the rod, brushed the connector points with a stainless brush, added a little conductive sealant on top of the connector, threadlocked the threads and yanked it tight. All great for practice, but it didn't help - AT ALL. No change. At this point, I was pretty sure I had a dud radio - but I thought I'd take the opportunity to tinker. I noticed (according to my JK's compass) that when running N/S routes reception was better than on E/W routes - so I figured it should have something to do with the antenna position or cable path, causing a blind spot during E/W-W/E travel. It wasn't a BIG difference, but it was a needling concern over 10 years of ownership. I decided that a good course could be to replace the antenna AND cable with a new setup - to see if that helped at all. I ordered this one: Antenna and I also got a rubber ducky to replace the whip outside. I first installed the whip, knowing that it wouldn't help (but at the same time knowing I've never trusted a stainless whip as an antenna anyway). It didn't help. Nor did installing the new antenna and cable!!! Well, not until I monkeyed with the installation some (more than some, but not a lot). with the dash still open, I tried a couple a placements for the antenna - along the rollcage horizontal top supports. down the passenger and the driver side was less than stellar performance, and the cable isn't long enough to reach the center of my unlimited rig. i ended up with the best performance when I put the antenna over the dash inside the plastic cowling along the top of the windshield. I directed the cable through the cowling over the passenger sun visor - and down the inner cowling of the windshield vertical support. From there I entered the dash and used zip ties to route it over the glove compartment and keep it tucked away - then into the center dash compartment from behind the dash. By manipulating it an playing with the routing, I found that crossing the glove compartment straight across, then turning the cable at a 90 degree angle to the front of the compartment, and around the radio installation support frame, behind the radio compartment and into the back of the radio. If you're not careful about that cable path it may cause some issues. I found that it's also important to get the cable connector on the antenna cable clear of the other wires and harnesses in the compartment as well - move the connector up behind the radio in the front portion of the dash for the best performance. Now the Radio works great - I get all the local stations in full stereo, many distant stations, and even catch some dx when the weather is right. I still notice some deleterious effects when the weather is heavy in my area, but we are mountainous - so it's not unexpected. Overall, I would gauge this as at least a 500% improvement in reception. That's estimated, not based on empirical analysis. I STRONGLY recommend this configuration and the products I have mentioned. I hope you have as much good luck as I did -and enjoy the ride!! (I enjoy it a little more with some great tunes to blare when it's time to go topless!!)"

Basically turning it into a mini laptop. It definitely serves that purpose. It's so much easier to type out an email with the Bluetooth keyboard rather than the onscreen keyboard that I find difficult and cumbersome to use. It did take me quite some time to get the keyboard to pair with my Nook. I almost gave up on it when it finally showed up in the device list on the Nook. Once it paired it the first time there hasn't been any real issues since. The only annoying thing is it doesn't always automatically sync to the keyboard each time you turn everything on. I often have to go back into settings and &#34;connect&#34; to it again. I've also used the keyboard with my iPhone and that works really well also. The keyboard detaches from the case very easily as well so you are not tied to the case, you can stretch out at a table and have the tablet standing up independently from the keyboard portion. It's only held in the case by a magnet. Overall I would recommend it."

Audio gets so choppy it's unreadable. Seller is great though! He tried to make it work and eventually refunded my purchase. This radio is a great design with too many bugs right now. Work the bugs out and 5 stars it will be!  First off, if you have ever programmed a Chinese radio, this is exactly the same. It works as it should. 25 watts VHF is spot on and 20 watts UHV is close enough. I like that you can program the memory channel name through the menu. For those having trouble with programming the offset, it is actually pretty easy - first select the receive frequency and save it to a memory channel. Then switch back to VFO mode and select the transmit frequency and tone if needed and then save it to the same memory channel. Most Chinese radio program offsets this way and while it is a pain in the a$$ it does work. You can then switch to channel mode and enter the alpha name if you want. It is definitely easier to program using the cable and chirp but it can be done with the menus if you have the time. 5 stars simply because the bang for the buck is there. You will not find a dual band radio in in this price range that does 25 watts and actually works. I have worked several nets and had very good audio reports. I can hit repeaters 40 miles away using my Workman UVS-200 antenna mounted 25' on my roof. Not bad for less than 1/4 the cost of some other dual banders. It does not do cross band repeat."

B008FLE7PA,DC/DC 3.5-30V to 4.0-30V Booster Converter Step Up Voltage Regulator LM2587,Mobile_Electronics,4,"DC/DC Boost Converter with LM2587S Voltage Regulator. Input: 3.5V to 30V. Output: 4.0V to 30V.<br /><br />I want to thank all who contributed their insights on the DC/DC Boost Converter with LM2587S Regulator. Since the converters did not have their own instructions, the experiences of others were very valuable to me. So, I decided to do my own tests for a future thermoelectric generator application. Given my abbreviated verification testing was rudimentary at best; the results showed the converters work.<br /><br />Note. The LM2587 is rated for 5A, but that's a maximum rating for a particular application. Other components in this converter impose limits: the SS34 diode has a 3A rating and 40V [repetitive] peak inverse voltage max. The capacitors are limited to 35V max. Please keep these limits in mind.<br /><br />So, the purpose of this exercise was to test and compile instructions for the DC/DC boost converter. Test instrumentation and other equipment included a regulated DC power supply, a fuse assembly, digital multimeter and the requisite test leads.<br /><br />The procedures included first placing a 2 ampere (A) fuse in series with the negative input lead from a regulated DC power supply and setting its potential to 5-volts (V). Initially, I tried to adjust the converter while connected to a 100 load resistor as others suggested. This closed circuit method did not work for me. Thus, all adjustments were done “open circuit”.<br /><br />I then turned the converter’s potentiometer (blue trim pot) counterclockwise (CCW) with it connected to the 5V supply and adjusted the converter’s output to 18V.<br /><br />The 18V output remained stable even with a 3V input potential. With a 3V input, the converter’s input current fluctuated from 0.01 to 0.02A, but the 18V output was essentially stable. Increasing the input to 4V stabilized the current at 0.01A. So, I set each converter for an 18VDC output given a 4VDC input.<br /><br />I also checked each converter’s output before making any adjustments. In each case, the “factory default” converter output ranged from 20 to 22VDC. I could not verify the “3x rule” whereby the output should not exceed the input by a 3:1 ratio.<br /><br />I reviewed the LM2587 specification sheet and applications notes; available from Texas Instruments and National Semiconductor websites. The LM2587 “Simple Switcher® 5A Flyback Regulator” is the only active component - the converter’s overall function relies on it. The spec sheets do not cite a “3x rule”.<br /><br />Per the specification sheet, when used as a boost (step-up) switching regulator, the LM2587 produces an output voltage greater than the input supply voltage; it does not mention a specific ratio. Though this particular converter design could have this limitation.<br /><br />T. RANEY...bald engineer guy with glasses"

B00RLECSXK,Mesinton RustProof 90-360mm Hight 2 Tonne Car Van Scissor Wind Up Jack Lift + Chromed Crank Speed Handle for cars,Mobile_Electronics,5,Bought this after jacking up my Scion jack on my wife's car.  I did not see a weight stamp on the package or jack but my Xb is real light so I know there are no issues.  I like that the jack has a crank eye.  I use my cordless drill with a j hook to speed up the jacking action.  It took a while to get but well worth the wait.
B00NG83IBQ,uxcell JDM Blue Glass 300mm Wide Convex Clip On Anti-Glare Rear View Mirror,Mobile_Electronics,2,It's not convex at all but it's usable.  Can't complain about the price.
B00QMMBXA6,"Tomtom VIA 1515M Automobile Portable GPS Navigator - Black, Gray",Mobile_Electronics,5,"I bought this at a store because it was on sale at a good price.  But have been shopping for a new GPS on Amazon for a while.  I have a old TomTom that works okay.  However, need to pay for map updates, so thought it was time to upgrade.  First this unit is fast processing information.  I was amazed at the speed compared to my older unit.  I looked on the TomTom website and this is the one listed for sale there.  Wanted to get a model that was current.  TomTom has many model numbers and didn't want to buy something they discontinued.  Needed to travel to 2 different places today that I needed a GPS for.  I was impressed with verbal commands, lane guidance and upcoming turns.  This is a simple GPS that really gets the job done well. The updates are very simple once you open a TomTom account.  Just plug it into your home computer and click a few buttons.  It's done such a good job, that I'm treating it to a carrying case."

B00RDCMYAW,Bluetooth Shower Speaker – SoundPal Water Resistant Wireless and Hands-free Speaker with Suction Cup - Compatible with All Bluetooth Devices,Mobile_Electronics,1,Does not hold a charge. ...I use for 10 minutes turn off completely and it needs to be charged again before next use.  Also Speaker quality is horrible. You get what you pay for but I'd at the very least expect decent use past the very first day.
B00JWKHZ5W,"MOGOI(TM) Anti Drowsy Alarm Drive Alert Nap Snooze Wake Up Warning Reminder,Black With MOGOI Accessory Wire Winder",Mobile_Electronics,3,"OK, when I got it, didn't work, had to open it up and fix a wire.  Works now, but only used it once, hope it keeps on working when I do need it."
B00V92WCY0,Garmin nüvi 3597LMTHD 5-Inch Portable Bluetooth Vehicle GPS with Lifetime Maps and HD Traffic,Mobile_Electronics,5,Very good device. Minor con: bulky supply cable (only needed for traffic info).
