Why these picks cannot be found more generally is a really mystery - to quote a recent reviewer.

I've had it a year now,  wanting to use a product thoroughly before leaving a rating.<br /><br />No thanks to RLS and Fibramyalgia,  I must take different medications 5 lousy times a day.  I used to forget one or two times every day, and would then really suffer.  The Watchminder quietly reminds me not only that it is time to take the med's,  but also which set of meds,  thanks to the watch's ability to allow a written reminder.  It has never failed me,  ever.  And I'm not a gentle wearer; I am outside gardening, riding ATV's,  jet boating,  doing housework,  on and on.  The watch face is banged and scratched and I've changed the band to a stretch band,  but that's been my only change.  Once forgot to charge it (needs charging about once every 3 weeks),  and the batt went dead, dead, with watch face totally blank.  It charged right back up again,  just fine.<br /><br />You truly are buying a watch with quality and efficiency.  And did I mention it keeps on-the-dot time too?  LOVE THIS PURCHASE!"

B008MA41S2,"Soozier Full Round Massage Bolster Pillow - Black - 25"" x 6""",Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"Terrible product and terrible customer service as they wouldn't provide a return even within the 30 days of purchase.

A bit of a beast to put together... (lots of nuts and bolts.) Sturdy and easy to use... no good for folks without a curtain type shower.

B00H9L7VIW,"boostULTIMATE - 60 Capsules - Increase Workout Stamina, Muscle Size, Energy & More 1 Month Supply",Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"(Disclosure: I have been provided this product to test with the understanding that I will write a product review that is accurate and completely honest.) As I age, I have concerns about maintaining a youthful level of testosterone. While I do not suffer from ED or low libido, there are many other reasons that men would want to insure adequate and healthy testosterone production, muscle-body fat ratio, bone density, brain health, etc. One of the drawbacks to many low-T therapies is hair loss. When I looked at the list of ingredients in this product I saw “pumpkin seed powder” which helps prevent the conversion of testosterone to DHT which contributes to hair loss. I looked at the other ingredients and was familiar nearly all the ingredients, having most of them already in my vitamin cabinet in some form or another. Based on that I figured I would give this product a try. The first day I took the product, within hours I felt like I’d swallowed a fistful of guarana capsules - I was zooming. I did not think much about it or even relate it to taking the product. By day 4 I became alarmed as I nearly no sleep for the previous three nights. I went back to ingredients list of the product and saw a name I did not recognize, Tongkat Ali - the main ingredient. I googled side effects for Tongkat Ali (which goes by many different names) and found it under the name EURYCOMA LONGIFOLIA on WebMD. While there was nothing to suggest that there is anything wrong with using the herb, I did read that sleeplessness is one possible side effect. I went back to the product bottle, and it is listed there as a reason to discontinue use, I immediately stopped taking it for the rest of the week. I decided I would start again in one week, but drop the dose to half, a single pill per day and see if that would be different. Unfortunately I had the same speedy, sleepless reaction to even half a dose. While I can find nothing wrong with the product or its ingredients via Google searches, it seems like it may not be for people like me who are highly reactive to drug in general. And like any supplement, read the warning label on the product before using."

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"This is a great product to use.  I have eczema, and I have been searching for something natural to use on my skin rather than the cortisone cream which can be harmful to a persons skin after multiple uses.  When applying this product you notice that the consistency isn't like your typical cream, but it goes on the skin like butter, gliding through nicely.  It also absorbs well into the skin keeping it hydrated.  The reason that I give this product a 4 is because I felt that it didn't really hydrate my skin for 8-12 hours like it says on the description.  I felt that I kept having to reapply the cream multiple times per day, and because of this I ran out of the product quickly. The redness from my eczema was more calm after using this product, however, I still shed flakes due to my dry skin on my face, so like I said before I found myself having to reapply the cream, and I have been using this product for 3 weeks now.  Overall though it is a great product and I do recommend it for people that have eczema! It's not a cure for it, however, it does control it well."

B006J7C2W2,Hydrea London Natural Bristle Body Brush FSC Beechwood,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,Same type of softness as their Medium Strength brush - perfect for sensitive skin. I really enjoy using it.  ETA after several months of use:  This brush is not best when used wet  in the shower. Contact with water hardens the bristles making the brush very coarse and too harsh for the skin. It ends up over-exfoliating the skin making it dry and flaky.  When used try - it's fine. very pleasant experience.

I have tried so many brushes (both from Amazon and from stores like Body Shop, etc), and ended up throwing them all away because they were hurting my skin.

I also have one that is pinching a nerve that causes pain and numbness down my left arm and one that is pinching a nerve that caused excruciating headaches. The doctors cannot do anything so I choose the natural remedies. This stuff is amazing! I have tried specialty medications that were compounded just for me which costs an arm and a leg. This stuff is 1/4 of the cost, lasts longer and works better. The smell is very strong and to most it isn't a pleasant smell but I quite like it. The oil its self is very strong as well and if not used properly or too much it can burn you, but I have never had that  problem. If it does get to much for your skin you can use a small amount of mineral oil to help with the burning sensation."

B00HES9CMS,"Viva Naturals #1 Best Selling Certified Organic Cacao Powder from Superior Criollo Beans, 1 LB Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have seen cacao my entire life and have bought it for recipes but never thought there was any difference. There is a big difference and there's not much of a difference. From what I read. The Cacao Bean and Coco Bean are one in the same.. It's all in the way its processed and if its processed. Cacao is the purest form of chocolate. They think that cacao has the highest of magnesium and antioxidants , high in fiber and many other healthy attribute. Even though Cocoa is possessed at a higher heat and from a different part of the some bean as cacao, it still retains a huge amount of the same nutritional values.  I haven't had the chance to make any recipes that allow the cacao.  but I have added it to a few things that really set it off.. We made brownies the other night and added  bit to those.. It made them super, super chocolaty. I also took a que from a website where I learned about the beans where it was talking about making adding it to coffee.. I added a heaping spoonful to my coffee that I brewed in my french press. It was a bit too chocolaty, so the next one I added half a spoonful. Perfect.. I add creamer and sugar to my coffee, so it turned it into the perfect mocha, just right…. YUM! I will be using cacao instead of coco from now on. I use a lot of coconut oil, agave nectar , coconut flour etc , so this actually fits perfectly with the ingredients I already have in my pantry. Im at the tipping point age, so every bit helps keep me from tilting too far in the wrong direction and it helps me keep start my kids off right, teaching them how to eat healthy and know why they eat what they eat   DISCLAIMER :  My No Nonsense Thoughts: I could reiterate what is in the description above, but  you've  most likely already read it.

This stuff is natural, way better for you and increases libido which viagra can NOT do.  I'm 50 and my problem was sustaining hardness and declining libido.  The ED problem is now solved and I'd say after 2 weeks that I have perhaps a 20 to 25% increase in libido.  I'll take that anyday!  I was truly a sceptic but now I believe in this product.  I was given a free bottle to try which also indicates to me that they are really confident in their product, and for good reason.  Bottle line, I'm giving kudos where it's deserved.  It may not work for everyone but worked for me."

B00972EATY,RECLINING SHAMPOO STYLING HYDRAULIC BARBER CHAIR HAIR BEAUTY SALON EQUIPMENT BLACK,Personal_Care_Appliances,1,I would give no stars if i could. The chair is very flimsy and the screws were not tight when arrived. The footrest is also very short and too high. Very uncomfortable. But the main reason I do not like this chair is because the chair will not stay up while servicing a client. Even when not reclined the chair will still fall back. DO NOT BUY!!!!!

I have to be very careful to keep those skin areas moisturized with something anti-bacterial. It can't be just any old moisturizer. And I have to guard against skin ulcers. I've been using a very expensive ointment that works well, but tried this (which is less costly) to see how it would do. It's doing quite well and I've incorporated it into my twice-daily application routine. Plus, this company has superb customer service. The owner emailed me personally to see how the product was doing for me...and followed up. I was very impressed. I am going to be using this on a regular basis as part of my skin care for my dermatitis, as it's very calming to those inflamed patches and it's doing the job I need it to do. And what a great company!"

However I don't like the pain that came with it. My feet would hurt and my lower back pain was bad. Then a friend pointed me to this product and I just had to try it. I already had a tens machine but needed pads and I love these butterfly pads. I love the way that they distribute electrodes in different areas. These pads are definitely well worth giving a shot. Great for all kinds of pain in different areas of your body. I even use these on my daughter who gets foot pain because of flat feet and being an avid gymnast and cheerleader."

I end up with painful blisters on the knuckles if I don't pad them.  Individual toe caps have been my first choice, but these little &#34;sleeves&#34; work very well and they are much faster.  They are very soft and squishy and slide easily into nearly any shoe I own.  They do make the shoe a little bit more snug, but not enough to be a problem.  If they show in your ballet flat, you can trim them to fit I think, as they are soft enough to be cut with scissors."

Some days I can take 19 pills so I went with the large and everything fits perfect.  I'm buying the small for the couple pills I have to take in the mornings.<br /><br />It is constructed of a very hard plastic that is quite sturdy.  I think the reviews that complained about cracked threads didn't line up the threads right and forced it. Every couple of months I dab a tiny bit of Vaseline on the threads to keep them screwing smoothly.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please let me know by clucking &#34;Yes&#34;.

B00QR4JRHU,Bunion Regulator,Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"I purchased these bunion regulators for my wife a couple of weeks ago. They seem to work, as her great toe is maintained in a straight position, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the product. She woke up one morning and one of the bunion regulators had completely torn in two. She is very careful with her things and wore socks to secure the regulator, but it still tore in two. The product works, but will not last long at all. I haven't been able to figure out how to contact the company for a replacement. I will update this review if they reach out to me. Otherwise, I'm leaving the two stars for the poor durability of the product."

I actually purchased this unit for my daughter to use while we &#34;bicycled&#34; together on trainers, and was surprised when she told me it failed to work. The unit I used (a different manufacturer) was able to monitor both my Sat O2 and pulse fine, so we swapped units and my unit worked well on her finger while this one also failed to work on mine."

B0006VJ6TO,Body Back Company’s Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Therapy Self Massage Tool - PARENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have several back injuries, most of high levels of impact and foolishness.  I've used several massaging type devices and see a professional massage therapist on a semi-regular basis.  With that said, I laughed when I first saw one of these- but got goose bumps as soon as I put it on one of my trouble spots (right under my left scapula).  The ability to apply heavy pressure to the exact spot is awesome.  While it looks reeeeealy weird, all the funky nodules on it actually have different purposes- all of which is outline in the small pamphlet that comes with it (and more info online, I'm told).  I definitely recommend."

Even at regular price, this is an incredible deal. Now, the reason for a missing star is that this product tends to make me feel overstimulated even in small amounts. I made chocolate using this cacao with coconut oil, raw honey, vanilla extract, and salt and even the smallest amount made me feel hyped up and light-headed. Now when I used this in brownies, I never had an issue so I think there is a difference when raw like in my homemade chocolate."

B00HES9CMS,"Viva Naturals #1 Best Selling Certified Organic Cacao Powder from Superior Criollo Beans, 1 LB Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"This is good cacao, and a good price considering that it's organic.  Coming from a lifelong Hershey's cocoa user, be prepared for this to have a different taste.  Another reviewer described it as more acidic.  Maybe that's it.  I would definitely cut back on the suggested 2-3 Tbsp. in a drink if you're not used to it.  I tried it in coffee and had to choke it down.  Overall, though, I'm happy with the product and the price."

B00J7G934C,"Oral-B Super Floss, Dental Floss, Original (50-count)",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"My dentist recommended this floss after some new dental work.  It comes packaged in a convenient box that you open like you would a standard kleenex book so that you can pull the pieces out one at a time.  There is a stiff piece on the end for the purpose of threading the floss through the teeth. Is is followed by another approximate 6&#34; section that is thicker and fluffy to clean out wider areas or in my case, the area above the middle tooth in the bridge. This is followed by a very long piece of standard floss which is still a little thicker and ropier than the oral B floss I am used to using. The floss is excessively long in my opinion and although it works very well on my bridge, I find that the floss part itself is too thick for the rest of my mouth which means that I am only using about 1/3 of each piece.  I wish the pieces were shorter because it seems very wasteful for my mouth."

B00PA7WMTU,"QingHan Baby Girls 3"" Grosgrain Ribbon Boutique Hair Bows Alligator Clips Pack Of 20",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I received these bows and my excited 6 year old promptly tried on several. I didn't notice that one was missing until I found it in the washing machine! But it held together and looks just fine!<br />These bows came in a handy zip pouch and were beautiful and fluffy straight out of the package. I was worried they may be flat like other brands I have purchased but the pouch and cardboard box they were shipped in really protected them. The colors are bright are perfect to match a little girl's wardrobe. I love how they can be used in casual or dressy outfits. The satin flowers aren't just a one piece pressed flower, it is several small pleats that give it more volume and depth. We have tried both single bows as well as making combinations with them. The clips are alligator style clips that hold well in my daughter's fine hair. They do not seem to poke her head or pull her hair. The clips will slip after extended hard playing but I would expect that with an active child.<br />I was chosen to receive this product at a discount in order to give an honest review."

B011OI71X0,Black 1650 Mah V2 Battery /W Mini Pro Tank 3 and USB Charger CLONE Starter Kit,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"This is my first vapor device and I'm very happy with it and the $41 price I paid to get it. I have seen the price on these clones anywhere form $41 to $100 for the entire unit.<br /><br />So I would really check out the costs to make sure your not paying top dollar for your device.<br />What I like about it:<br />It's built very well and seems like it could survive a accidental drop<br />It has a huge tank that's simple to fill once you check out a youtube video to learn how if your new to these devices.<br />Huge powerful battery, with 4 different output voltages that allow larger hits if that what you want.<br />Charges fully in about 4 hours.<br />Does not leak any juice into your mouth which really is gross!<br />Seems like it will last a long time with a replaceable battery.<br />Has a optional LED flashlight that can be added to the battery for a very powerful flashlight.<br />Can add any 510 thread tank!<br />Has a two color battery power indicator that cheaper vaps do not have. This one will light up white with a full charge and light up blue when the charge is in the 30% left range. (Great feature that I have not seen on my friends $35 unit)<br />On/Off is as simple as pushing the power button 5 times within two seconds and it works well.<br /><br />Seeing that this is my first purchase of a vap device that I use for nicotine addiction I'm smoking less real cigs from 2 packs a day down to one.<br /><br />This for me is going to hopefully help me quit smoking all together. However, in the mean time this will give me the hand to mouth addiction in a way that does not harm my lungs like real smoke will.<br /><br />If you want a good vapor pen this is a really good one and my best friend who has bought several of these is now buying this one based on how great it is. So the experience I lack is made up with my friends and he thinks this is a excellent vapor device and will be buying one very soon."
B00HES9CMS,"Viva Naturals #1 Best Selling Certified Organic Cacao Powder from Superior Criollo Beans, 1 LB Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"This is really delicious!

B00XZJ2G46,"Vision Spinner II Variable Voltage Battery, 1600mAh",Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"This battery seems to be getting a lot of hate, I personally haven't had any major problems with it. Just take care of the thing, I've dropped mine a few times and the top of the battery is getting loose but a few drops of super glue will fix that. My old tank was leaking a ton and I didn't notice the battery held up really well with a tank leaking juice onto it for a week. I've had it for two weeks and can say it's decent, if you're really hurting on money or can't go to a vape shop then buy it it'll do the job, other than that save your money and get a better one."

The nurse where she lives in a independent living apartment strongly recommended this GMS Med-E-Lert 28-Day pill dispenser and I researched it & others for hours.  We all love it!  We have hers set for 8:30 am & 7 pm & even if she is not wearing her hearing aides she can hear the alarm go off....even if she is in another room.  Fantastic product!  Only wish the compartments were slightly bigger because some of her pills (fish oil, eye pill & others) are kinda big & do get stuck only once in a while.  Funny thing is....my husband has 2 precription pills he must take in the morning & one @ night & keeps forgetting to take them so I'm going to buy one for him also. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!"

B00PA7WMTU,"QingHan Baby Girls 3"" Grosgrain Ribbon Boutique Hair Bows Alligator Clips Pack Of 20",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Wow!! These are the cutest and the just the perfect sized clips I ever purchased for my little gal! Love love love the awesome colors that the clips come in. These clips came in a very smart and translucent zip pouch, perfect for storing the clips especially if you are short on storage space. These clips are perfect for small babies. I stumbled upon these clips as I have a 9 month old who has yummy hair which keeps sliding over her eyes. I love her hair and did not want to trim it, also, I do not want it getting in the way while she is busy getting the hand of crawling all over the house. A few things I loved about these clips are that the flowers are made with a very high quality satin ribbon. The material used in making the flowers and the use of vibrant colors ensures the classic look of these clips! The small pearl stuck to the center of the flower just takes the brilliance of these clips to another level. What I really liked about the clips was the fact that part of the clips, the top part and the actual part where you hold the clip to put on or take off is also covered in a ribbon of the same color as the flowers giving the clip a finished classy look. Also, the ribbon where you hold the clip is textured to ensure ease of use and prevents the clip from accidentally sliding off from your hands while you are attempting to put it on or take it off! Very thoughtful indeed! The clip itself is not an alligator clip and at times slides off if not put on correctly, but would I rather it slide off than cling on to a few strands of dear daughters hair and put her in pain. All in all, I love the range of colors and the quality of clips and I am sure that they will last us a long while! I will definitely return to purchase more if the need arises! Disclaimer: I was one of the lucky few who was able to get an opportunity to purchase the clips at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. Yay for that! Please comment with any questions you may have that I can help with. If you do find this review helpful please let me know!"

I tested them out a little bit and packed up my shoes for the trip. Not even 30 minutes into the event, both heels pushed straight through the &#34;protectors&#34; and one of the heels is really scuffed up, with visible scratches on it. I was not pleased that these things did not do their job and actually damaged my shoes instead."

B000KNA6KQ,Invacare Clamp-On Raised Toilet Seat with Arms,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"First, in spite of the promise of 6-10 day delivery period, it arrived in 2 days!  Might be that it was shipped from an adjacent state might have something to do with that.  This product really works for me.  No, no broken bones or other drastic problems - just getting old.  I had gotten to the point to get off the toilet I had to grab the sink with one had and push, and the door jam with the other hand and pull.  And it was getting more difficult. I first like a good little boy read the instructions carefully - but in this case there wern't needed.  The seat slips on the toilet very easily.  Just tighten the knob a bit (not too much) and it holds in place very well.  When I stand to use to commode, a couple of turns of the knob and it slips right off to set aside (very light).  True, one has to stand to wipe - but that turned out no problem.  Cleaning it is a snap.  Oh, the actual purpose - to get off the toilet without strain - perfect.  What a relief!"
B00RIPGYRS,"Compression Arm Sleeves, UV Protection Cooler, Sports Elbow Warmers Support for Cycling,Golf,Hiking,Baseball,Basketball 1 Pair",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,I wore these on a bike ride. Usually my hands get pin and needles a lot but with the arm compression these symptoms were alleviated. They also helped reduce fatigue in my right bicep which has been surgically reattached.
B002SIE4OA,"BACK-A-LINE HEAVY DUTY BACK SUPPORT - X-Large (39""-44"")",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"The Back-A-Line has been one of the best braces I've ever purchased to help with an arthritic lumbar spine.Because it doesn't stretch, it gives better support. It's also quite comfortable and can be worn under or over clothing (I prefer over). As with most lumbar braces, this one also has a tendency to slip up the spine when you're sitting. I recommend taking it off when sitting or lying down and wearing it when walking or standing. This brace has allowed me to walk limited distances until I get my back surgery. How much it will help you depends upon the condition of your spine and your core strength. For me, it's been a BIG help."

B00DTX9GE6,FIDGIPOD BY DESK BUDDY NUMBER ONE SELLING HAND FIDGET FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN WITH SENSORY ISSUES,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I bought this to help with my trichotillomania (excessive skin picking), and I keep it on my desk at work.  Whenever I get the urge to pick or start scanning my fingers, I put it in front of me and run my fingernails over the top or sometimes pick at the sides.  It provides good, tangible stimulation for fingernails and finger pads.  It has a pretty wide base so it doesn't slip around on my desk and I'm picking it, unless I'm picking hard at it.  The only con is that it has a very faint plastic smell (you can't really notice it unless you pick it up and put it right up to your nose and inhale) which transfers a light scent to my fingers (again, very faint, but there).<br /><br />Overall I'm finding it helpful at work, and plan to buy the smaller versions to carry around with me throughout the day."

It's listed as a men's women's watch but this watch would be way to big for me. I have 2 boys that run cross country so I thought this would be perfect for the larger of the two. Nope, it's so big he can' t wear it. Also, there were no instructions in the box so he didn't know how to change the time and such. If your small in stature at all, I would look elsewhere but if our larger framed, then this would be a good watch for you.

I got it a week before we moved across the country, and with all the expenses of the move we couldn't afford to send me for a professional massage. However, this stick helped immensely as a substitute. You wouldn't think a stick could help much, but it really does. The rollers on it have some ridges, which allow for extra pressure points to be hit. The handles have grips for easy handling, both by yourself or by someone using it on you. It's a very basic concept. You roll it up and down the sore area, adjusting the pressure as desired. Simple, yet effective. A lot of areas you can use this on yourself, but for your back and stuff it's more effective  for someone else to help you out. This is a great product that will bring you muscle tension relief! Note: Item sent at no cost to me to test and provide a review."
B00NU6H3PQ,Taylor Bluetooth Body Fat Smart Scale w/ 400 lb Capacity and SmarTrack App,Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"I've covered a couple of different bathroom scales on here, and most of them have been fairly basic. I have one from Ozeri that measures body fat, bone, muscle and water levels too. I'm very happy with it. One even had it's own &#34;app&#34;. But until now, I'd not had one with bluetooth. In steps Taylor, a Salter Housewares brand, with their Taylor Smart Scale with Bluetooth, model 7222F.<br /><br />It has the fairly standard tempered glass surface, this time with stainless steel strips inlaid for the measuring of all those extra metrics like body fat, body water and muscle mass. And it then beams those numbers via bluetooth to your paired smartphone or tablet via their SmarTrack app. At least in theory, that is, because I could not get the app to register me, despite multiple tries on my phone, tablet, and over both our FiOS wifi and 4G network connection. Which, essentially, renders the features that most folks paid extra for useless. Shame. The idea behind easy and convenient tracking of your weight, and your fitness, is a good one, but one of these days these companies really need to understand app development and that it's more than throwing a few dollars at an IT company that bid the lowest to cobble together what amounts to placeholder to be able to say you &#34;have an app&#34;. It has to work, people.<br /><br />Okay. Deep breath.<br /><br />Aside from the incredible amount of frustration caused by this, the scale in and of itself is accurate, and while the numbers were slightly off from the other body fat-measuring scales we have here in the house, that can simply be chalked up to the fact that they all use &#34;estimates&#34; from small electrical signals sent through the body, and so many factors can skew that, I'm not going to begrudge a scale a few percentage points here and there. Up to 8 people can use this scale with basic non-bluetooth tracking features, an &#34;athlete&#34; setting for those that work out regularly, and a bright, dual-line backlit LCD readout with &#34;touchscreen&#34; controls. All this and it operates on 3 AAA batteries. Unfortunately, most of the advertised features like true tracking, cloud storage, and compatibility with MapMyFitness, RunKeeper and other popular apps are inaccessible due to the native app being useless. So it quickly becomes less and less a value because, let's face it, you paid for those features. I wanted to like this product so much more, and I've had Taylor, Salter, and Homedics scales before that were fantastic. This scale is, as a scale, flawless. It's all the advertised extras that caused the premium pricetag that are rendered useless by a non-functioning, junk app. For that reason, I find that I can't, at full retail, recommend this product, because so many of the potentially wonderful features advertised cannot be accessed, and they're built into the price tag. Too bad.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Taylor Precision Products.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.t LCD readout with &#34;touchscreen&#34; controls. All this and it operates on 3 AAA batteries.

Boost Ultimate has the natural products that do make a difference in T production.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel the impact was substantial.  Granted, I could have somewhat of a natural tolerance for natural products since I've tried a fair share, but there are other products that have a dramatically more impactful change.  For those trying natural T products, this is a great intro.  The blend is good, the claims are on par with what one could expect.  Just don't expect miracles.  You'll feel a little more urge, a little more present where it counts, but nothing that will rock your socks off.  Overall a good product.  I did receive this as a free trial for my time."

This product is working beyond my expectation. I am only using 1 capsule daily instead of the recommended  two daily capsules and I can still see the results.

B004R7KFRA,Kiwi Fresh Force Spray,Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"I just don't like the smell. The design is clever and works very well, however the scent just doesn't smell good to me. It's very strong, and it reminds me of bowling lane alleys when they spray disinfectant into the rental shoes. It kind of tries to mask over the smell in shoes and doesn't exactly fix the problem. I haven't finished the first can, and my other two cans are brand new untouched. If you personally like it I'd be glad to sell it to you. Instead, I started using this product: Mini Moso Natural Air Purifying Bags https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0099K6OVQ/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_xd43vbZ98B17E  I would put those into my shoes every time I got home and took off my shoes to absorb the moisture, and then I bought some foot powder from my local dollar store (mostly talc with some menthol, acacia, peppermint, eucalyptus oil), and I would sprinkle some powder into my shoe before wearing them. With this routine, I haven't had much problem with moisture and odor anymore. By the way don't use baby powder, because the cornstarch will start to smell weird."

I had come off of the third collarbone surgery and was diagnosed with anemia when I started with boostUltimate. I have also made concurrent consumption and lifestyle changes over that same period of time. I don't know how much to attribute to boostUltimate but here are the results. Weight loss of 15 lbs, blood pressure drop from 140/90 to 115/70. Ability to sustain a running pace over 3 plus miles at 8:20 mile minutes (started at 11). Obviously I had a lot of work ahead of me.<br /><br />Also, low iron certainly can play a contributing role in lack of stamina on every front. But now after bU and 65mg iron each day, I have seen dramatic improvement and ability to stay in the intimacy game far longer than just a month ago. Again, I have no idea whether one product could play such a positive role but, like most physical challenges, there are usually several changes that need to take place in order to overcome."

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"The short story - This worked remarkably well for clearing a nasty case of eczema.<br /><br />The long story - For the past three and a half years I have been battling a particularly stubborn case of eczema on my hands.  It's always hard when it's on your hands because every day tasks become tortuously painful due to all the splits in your skin that develop.  I like to use natural cures, when possible, and had tried various things like coconut oil and an elimination diet (I had hopes of identifying something that I was eating that might be causing the problem.)  No real, lasting help came from any of those.  In desperation, I finally sought out a dermatologist who immediately wanted to give me the dreaded steroid shot.  I declined that so she gave me clobetasol propitiante.  This was a very expensive ointment and while it did help to knock the eczema back somewhat, it failed to completely clear it and it would always come roaring back after I stopped using it.  (I was only allowed to use it for 14 days, maximum.)  The last time I went to refill the prescription, the druggest said it would cost $200 for a tube.  Knowing that it would provide only partial and temporary relief, I decided to come to amazon instead and see if I could find anything that was getting good reviews.  Fortunately, I found e-ra oranics Relief.<br /><br />I started using it and the less damaged areas of my hands began to show improvement within just a few days.  I was surprised, but cautiously optimistic.  I continued to use it for several weeks, continuing to see improvement.  However, there was one particularly stubborn area on the outer edge of my hand and in toward my palm that just would not budge.  It had several splits and even when I babied it and kept it covered as much as possible, it just continued to split open on me day after day.  I wondered if I'd ever see improvement.  I knew if I could just get it to stop breaking open like that, I'd be able to improve.  I continued applying the era organics Relief, and finally!  It healed enough that the skin stopped breaking open in splits.  My hands are now about 98% normal, and that has been after nearly 3 1/2 years of constant torment.<br /><br />I'm on my fourth jar, but even at that I've only spent half of what that prescription would have cost me AND, the most important thing, I actually have been healed.  I'm so thankful and so amazed.  If you have ever had a severe attack of eczema, you know how miserable the itch is.  Sometimes it feels like you'll lose your mind scratching to stop the itch.  And then of course, all that scratching just damages your skin even more.  Then, as I said, there are the painful splits that make every day tasks like washing your hands a painful proposition.  My fingers had actually curled in somewhat, like claws.  It was BAD.  And it had made my life pretty miserable for a very long time.  So I can't thank the folks at Era Organics enough.  I will continue using this until I'm 100% healed and I will always keep some on hand, should a rash try to creep back.<br /><br />Btw, I very much like the feel of the cream.  It has a silky quality and is not greasy at all.<br /><br />If you or someone you love suffers with eczema, please give this a try and leave a comment in reply to my post to let me know how it helped you.<br /><br />In addition, I'd like to suggest anybody with a child or who is themself dealing with eczema read a very informative book by Dr. William Crook called, The Yeast Connection.  Between those two sources, you ought to find some relief.  Good luck!, and finally!  It healed enough that the skin stopped breaking open in splits.

B00H8PNZJI,Fisher & Paykel Simplus Full Face Mask Frame with Cushion (Large),Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"At this point, 4 stars is the best that I can give any of these CPAP masks, and I give this one 3 stars. I have tried 2 different masks, plus the nasal pillow air delivery system. The nasal pillows has been my least favorite. I require a CPAP machine since I have serious nasal congestion. This results in loud snoring through both my mouth and my nose (with my mouth closed), plus I often stop breathing entirely for long periods while sleeping. (Interestingly enough, I feel more rested in the morning without the CPAP machine. But I am required to use it most of the time.)<br /><br />This is a three piece mask. The plastic frame, plus the plastic mask itself, and the cushion around the mask. All three pieces are together in this kit. The harness is extra. The recommended head harness for this mask works, but does not fit a person's head perfectly when using this mask.<br /><br />I need the large mask since my nostrils will sometimes close up while I sleep and I will start breathing through my mouth. This allows my mouth to breath air in/out below the length of a regular normal size mask. I have the large size of this mask, which is what I needed.<br /><br />However, here is the problem that I sometimes run into with this mask. The mask will marginally slip to one side and escaping air will dry out one of my eyes. This results in a very bad day for that eye for most of that day. Occasionally an eye wash will help with this, but not always. (A condition that I am experiencing as I type this review.)<br /><br />As I said, I have not found the perfect CPAP mask yet. And this mask is OK on most days. But waking up to dry eye can sometimes mean a bad day for that eye all day."

B000KIJMG0,Memory Foam Face Cradle With Fleece Sherpa Cover,Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"I bought this face cradle a couple of years ago; never found a client who liked it and finally returned to my original plain Oakwroks face cradle last year.  It's big and squishy, but not enough breathing space for most and too much for others who felt their faces &#34;falling through&#34;; others complained of not being able to get their necks comfortable.  I have added it to my rummage."

Every body is different and will react differently to this vitamin. It made me more easily aggravated and irritable. But when I worked out I felt a little more strength in my workout. As for my performance in the bedroom, it was there but no different then when I took ginkgo biloba. I was good to go but my desire wasn't increased more than normal. For me, it didn't do what I expected but the interesting thing is that it worked as a pre-workout booster. I was more focused in my workout. The only bad side effect for me was my attitude. After I noticed that I was becoming more and more easily agitated I stopped taking it. It was an interesting try but not for me."

B00NHAKT92,Listerine UltraClean Floss - Mint - 30 yd,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Lets start with the packaging.  I found it nice and appealing until i tried to open it.  I had a very hard time peeling the plastic off. Took me a while to open and that was frustrating.  I do like that it is sealed well though to prevent contamination.  The case the floss is in is very nice i love the shape and color reminds me of a bright white tooth. Just what i want to be visualizing while getting ready to floss.  The case was easy to click open, which was great considering some other brands are very difficult to open.  I hate breaking nails trying to open packaging.  The smell of this floss is very pleasant not too strong and over powering, just the right amount of mintiness.  Pulling the floss out of the case was a little difficult the wheel was sticking and was hard to pull the floss out without a bit of effort.  I might have gotten a defective one though.  When i got the floss out it was very nice and ribbon like.  I also love how it stretches, because i hate when floss breaks when flossing and this will help prevent it.  Flossing with this was a breeze.  I have a few crowns and floss always gets stuck under them this got under them without getting stuck but still cleaning that area well.  I love how it just glides between my teeth without me tugging and puling and breaking the floss.  I only need one string of floss to get through my entire mouth!  My 7yr old son also tried it out and loved the taste and it was easy for him to maneuver throughout his mouth without a problem as well.  He said you guys need to make floss stick with this floss because he likes it so much!  Overall it's a great floss just need to fix some of the packaging issue.  My 5 stars is based on the floss only and not the packaging<br /><br />I like the floss could do without the packaging problems though"

I have been trying to thaw a frozen shoulder and recover my full range of motion. As a massage therapist, I am able to be very specific and leverage this tool into my body while lying comfortably on a themarest mat. It takes some creativity, but the different shapes of the end nobs help give access to areas that are otherwise impossible to reach. The toughness of this plastic gives firm pressure. The back buddy is solid without being too heavy or unweildy. I am grateful to have discovered this tool. I am sure that I will continue to use it for self care long after my shoulder has thawed."

On the other Pill Planner two days fit fairly snug, but the other five opened easy enough that I cannot depend on it to keep closed if I use them when I travel. The pill boxes these are replacing looked exactly the same, but the plastic was heavier and my old ones closed nice and tight. Apparently the quality varies a great deal from box to box."

B00QR4JRHU,Bunion Regulator,Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"I like to use a product for awhile before reviewing it. I was ecstatic to find this as my big toes are turning in and cutting into the toe next to them. I NEED something to cushion between and this seemed ideal. When I got them, it was a good thing, I thought. However, today one of them broke--the area where the &#34;pillow&#34; is attached to the rest of the product is simply too thin and can't hold up to the use it is supposedly designed for. No nail was cutting in to that area if you are trying to visualize this. If the product were not this pricey, it might be worth it, but $12 x 10 replacements a year is too much and I fear this is the amount of use someone who really needs the product will get out of it. I am not an athlete, nails are well trimmed, I don't wear tight shoes or high heels--this got as light of use as anyone designing it had a right to expect. I expected it to last a year. That would be reasonable--maybe got 5 weeks worth of wear--not reasonable."

B00NY42UWK,Personal Pedi Water Proof Electronic Hand and Foot File and Callus Remover,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"First off, I am a guy with a limp that creates nasty, hard, huge calluses. After total hip replacement, my one foot had become COVERED in rear side and part of bottom with a rock hard callus.  I bought this on a fluke, fully expecting any &#34;Seen On TV&#34; product to last 5 minutes and break.<br />I was very wrong; this thing is great... it sanded/ground down a PILE of dead skin from the callus before pain in hip got to much to bare and quit for the day.  The difference was shocking.. it went from rough and hard.. catching on carpets, derned SOCKS!! and sheets to smooth as could be (used both rollers - oddly enough, mine was made without the brush for some reason - lucky me!)<br />Today, I pulled the bad leg up and under the other so I could more readily reach the underside. I got at LEAST the same amount off as yesterday and now... my foot feels completely different. It is truly an amazing product and thank whoever the hell made it!  I had actually used a stone bit in a Dremel before to smooth out bad toenail cuts.. these stones seem to be sturdy, too.  Not sure why people are talking about needed a replacement... seriously wth are you using it on?!? I bet I did the usage that a normal person would need a YEAR to duplicate and there's zero ware on the stones.  Also, the heads on the unit are a &#34;snap&#34; to switch out.  Package doubles as a case to store it in when not in use (as long as you cut around the edges like I did; keeps it all in place and protected)"

B00RRKBWD0,New Version 3 Cigreen-X V3 RDA,Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"I have owned a ton of RDA's, this is by far my least favorite, i purchased it because it came with a chuff cap, I should of just bought a chuff cap for one of my mutation x rdas. At first I wasnt a fan of the hinge as it made building a bit tough, but I got over that because it is convenient(dripping while driving). The hinge broke in about a week. second the post screws are 2 different screws, the positive uses a philips while the negative runs a n allen key, I see now reason for this, and makes building on this tougher than it should. the post holes are way to small for a 'competition device' and they are not lined up at the same level. lastly the screws do not have enough thread if using large wire, like 22g or 20g.<br /><br />I would recommend going with an actual Mutation X, this thing does hit great and makes lots of clouds and decent flavor, but the design/build quality is of something that the worst clones are made of."

Sewcondly, I need to replace my batteries once a week, which I have been told, is average life. I am ther efore quitgew satisfied with the batteries. What is also really important to me is that the the tab is lorge enough for me to get a hold of. I have damaged nerves in my fingers which makes it difficult for me to use the smaller tabs. Of course, the makers could provide an even longer tab for people like me and the majority of older people who also have dfficulty with hearing aid batteries tabs."

I have chronic eczema (my entire life) & it's favorite spot to plague me now is my hands.  It's so annoying. ..chapped, dry, itchy, flakey, painful, cracking. I use steroid cream every night for years and it seems to be the only thing that helps.  I eat mostly organic but I'm thinking I may have a cows milk, nut, or other allergy.  I am disappointed that this cream doesn't help either of us,  but I'm not surprised.  I do think it's made of high quality ingredients and I'm sure it queens for others.  I've relegated to using it as a face cream and lotion for my baby until the jar runs out.  Won't purchase again though."

B00QH96JQC,The Muscle Stick Original Massage Roller,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,We ordered this for my daughter. She is a dancer and needed it to roll out her muscles after dancing. The physical therapist actually uses one that is slightly larger in therapy. I was actually expecting this to be the foam roller but when it arrived we just decided to keep it. My daughter ordered it through my prime because she wanted a purple foam roller. I think that she kept it for the color but she also knows that her PT uses one just like it. These rollers really seem to help smooth out the knots in her muscles after performances.

B0006VJ6TO,Body Back Company’s Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Therapy Self Massage Tool - PARENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I haven't had a chance to try out all of the trigger points the BodyBackBuddy has to offer, but it has really helped release tense spots for both myself and my husband.<br /><br />It works on trigger points.<br /><br />The directions that come with the self massager show you where to apply pressure and instruct you to apply it for 10-30 seconds and then rest and repeat 3 times.<br /><br />I think it does help and it's a great alternative when you can't get in for a massage or you're unable to afford a massage. This is a great alternative pain reliever. My husband really likes it.<br /><br />I think the only improvement would be if they could make this larger sized self massager fold up. It's pretty big, but its so that you can get the right leverage on the trigger points. The only issue is &#34;where do I put this thing?&#34; It doesn't really have a storage option since it doesn't fold. Right now ours just lays around the house, but I dislike that and would prefer to find a place for it to live. If it folded up that would be even better. Folded in half it would easily fit under a sink or in a closet when not in use.<br /><br />Of course if you're constantly needing to use a self massaging tool like this for pain relief then you may not find it necessary to have it folded up when not in use. It really is a very 'handy' item to have around.<br /><br />Im a massage addict and sometimes my family gets sick of giving me back rubs, so then I have to resort to my own methods and this seems to do the trick for those times when I really need a muscle released."

B000NIFVLM,"Serola Sacroiliac Belt, Small hip up to 34-Inch",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I saw a PT for joint and hip pain during my pregnancy. Turns out, the relaxin hormone  during my pregnancy was causing me a lot of pain sitting and walking. It got so bad that I started limping and after seeing a PT for a few months, he suggested I try this belt. He had warned me that breastfeeding would continue to cause my body to produce relaxin hormones, so I was prepared for the pain to come and go. Turns out, my son is now 17 months and the pain is back with a vengeance. There were times that sitting at work was very difficult, so I decided to purchase the belt and give it a try. I am SO ELATED that I did!! I wore it for at least 10 hours on the first day and when I went to bed at night, I felt so much better. The next day, I was literally pain free. On the third day, I did not wear my belt and I could feel the pain creeping back. I am happily wearing my belt now and will continue to wear it to keep the pain at bay. I will update my review after I have worn this for a longer period of time."

B000FU107C,Medical Grade Vaginal Dilator Set,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"This set is a good balance between price and quality. The set is exactly what you expect to get - 6 dilators, the handle, the bag, and some small sample lubricant. The quality of the dilators won't blow your mind; they're made out of a sturdy plastic. Fortunately, there are no seams on the dilators, so no worries about sharp edges. Unfortunately, the plastic tends to made loud clanking noises in the bag, which ruins most attempts to be discrete. They don't stack into each other perfectly to fix this, so you might find yourself packing some loose material into the storage back to prevent the dilators from clanking. Certainly a minor issue, but could be annoying for some.<br /><br />They're not expandable, but I believe that 6 is a good balance for gradual increase in diameter. The user must take responsibility to use them gradually and consistently, and that's how it should be. This will be a simple and effective tool for those who want to work on stretching out, but haven't had much success with fingers / vibrators after several attempts. This should be well worth the money for those who truly need it."

B0118Q011M,URPOWER 2nd Generation 300ml Aroma Essential Oil Diffuser Ultrasonic Air Humidifier with AUTO Shut off and 6-7 HOURS Continuous Diffusing - 7 Color Changing LED Lights and 4 Timer Settings,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"Unlike most of the reviews here I did not get a promotion on this, I bought it simply because it looked like it fit what I was looking for at the time, now that I've had it a week to try it I thought I'd come back & write a review for those who are skeptical of reviews from people who received items free. The thing that drew me to this diffuser the most was the fact that it holds 300ml of water, rather than only 125ml that the diffuser in my &#34;to be un-named oil distributor&#34; kit came with, that one runs out of water within a few hours & it's been annoying me to have to keep refilling it all the time, the URPOWER diffuser runs for hours on end without needing a refill, almost the whole night through. I LOVE that it has a mist opening on one side of the top of the unit instead of just coming out the top in the middle so that I can direct it off the edge of the dresser that I have it on, the other one I have the mist comes out the middle & I'm always worried about the wood getting ruined, with this one I don't have that problem. It runs fairly quietly & I like the color options on it & that I can turn them off also when I don't want the mood lighting. Another nice feature is that it has several time options to chose from or you can just set it to run (which is what I do most of the time) because it automatically turns off.<br /><br />I did take off one star for a few minor things that if changed would have made this perfect for me:<br />1) it does beep when it shuts off, which isn't too loud & hasn't really annoyed me yet but if you use it at night & are a light sleeper it might be enough to wake you<br />2) it is kind of stiff to put the lid on correctly, the lid fits over the base with water just fine but once you have it on it takes a bit more force than I think it should to try to get the arrows to line up at the bottom, it's gotten stuck a few times & it's been difficult to try to adjust while also trying not to slosh water around the inside.<br /><br />All in all though I like this diffuser way better than the other one that we have and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a larger volume diffuser!in all though I like this diffuser way better than the other one that we have and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a larger volume diffuser!"

Now in my early 50's they are sprinkled throughout the house :-).  The one thing that annoyed me was while driving I would have to take off my sun glasses and put on my reading glasses to work with the GPS or do other such things.  So I went looking for a set of sun glasses with built in reading glasses and found these.  They are great.  The style is just what I want and they work just as I had hopped, just tilt the head back and I can read my GPS no problem.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is I wish that the reading insert was just a smidge bigger.  I do recommend them for anyone else who has reached that part of life where you finally give in and know you always have to have a set of reading glasses in reach."

B00OSAUYTA,"Psoriasis & Eczema Cream 4oz Advanced Healing Non-Greasy Moisturizer with Organic Aloe Vera, Manuka Honey, Hemp Oil & More. Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"My daughter just started getting eczema so we've been looking for a cream that will soothe the irritated areas. This cream seems to do that - not as well as the prescription stuff, but this does work. I like how natural the ingredients are. It absorbs quickly, takes the scaliness away (with multiple uses), and feels good on the skin. I don't have eczema, but we live in an extremely dry climate which makes daily application of lotion a necessity. I prefer this cream to the big name brands I've used for years - the scent isn't overpowering and it's moisturizing without being greasy.<br /><br />I also like that Era Organics is a family owned company - they seem to care about their customers and they want you to like the product. They are open to answering questions and listen to your feedback. You really have nothing to lose with their 60 day money back guarantee. This is such a nice moisturizer that I can't imagine many people return it due to dissatisfaction with the results. My daughter and I have very different skin - and we're both very happy with it! Yes, it's a little on the expensive side, but the container is a good size. You don't need to use gobs of the cream to get results, and from what I've read, the ingredients are much higher quality than most drugstore brands.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Great stuff for the skin. It's long lasting, feels good, and the ingredients are soothing. Whether you have eczema, overly dry skin, some other various skin condition, or healthy skin you just want to keep moist and healthy, give this a try. I bet you'll be as happy with it as we are!"

B007OUYX66,Remington Smooth and Silky Full Size Epilator (EP6010),Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"This is my first epilator and I bought this item three-four years ago. It just conked out on me recently, so I'd say I got a pretty good use out of it. Does the job and pulls out every hair efficiently. However you do have to play around with which way you're stroking the surface of your skin as hair tends to grow out in different ways. I have coarse black hair and it pulls it out well. I've used this on ever part of my body where hair is unwanted (legs, underarms, arms, bikini line). Goes without saying that it WILL hurt the most for the first time, but if you have a high tolerance for pain I would highly recommend it. I don't like shaving or waxing but epilating is great and the rate of hair regrowth is slower. Hair grows back tapered so you won't look like a Yeti after a few days. I've also noticed that my hair grows back in patches because some old hair never grew back. So if you're some type of hair removal masochist, this item is for you."

It was a nice thick cream that, in general, will do nicely in the winter for regular dry skin. But did nothing for my eczema or rosacea that it claims it is for. It is over priced for me to buy for just a regular cream. Wasn't overly crazy about the smell, but I am sensitive to smells so I think most people won't have a problem with it. All in all, I won't buy again."

B0002DMANU,Duoderm Extra Thin Cgf Dressing,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"GREAT STUFF.  Originally introduced to this product by a plastic surgeon who said that it prevents scars from forming when you get a scrape.( I had a really scraped knee). Initially developed as thick foam gel bandage to be used on burn victims.  The idea is that you put it on and it seals out the air so no scab forms, thus no scar when healed.  Underneath the bandage,  new soft skin is growing.  The clear oozing  is normal part of the healing process.. Leave bandage on so the new skin can grow.  Change only when the oozing gets too much and flows out of the perimeter of the bandage or at least every other day.  Make sure the bandage is large enough  to extend around the wound itself  and leave extra to catch the oozing and I cut it in a circle so there are no edges to start to peel away.  No pain when pulling it off and not even  painful while on. I would put a new one on after shower.  Because these are quite expensive, I would only use these on the body parts where I did not want an ugly scar to form."

B00QH9M6QY,The Muscle Stick Original Massage Roller,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I like using this muscle roller mostly on my neck and thighs. I do prefer the hard plastic rollers to the foam rollers because these are much better for getting direct pressure and unkinking the knots. It's not very heavy and the its easy to use even with one arm if necessary.Using this roller does help ease my sore muscles, especially after soaking in a hot bath. This feels great on tired feet too. I am pleased with mine and want to pick up a blue one asca gift for my brother who is a big athlete and always pushing his body to the max.The colors are vibrant and the roller itself is well made to last. I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this roller myself."

They should just be honest and say that this only works on 25 or less in a small small space.  It is temperate with 50-60% humidity in my house and alone will not stay above 65%...

B00LMEWGCI,"Balance Living Buckwheat Pillow, King Size",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I was very hesitant about buying this pillow, a price I've never spent before, a material I've never used before, for a pillow. Now you would think the noise would irritate you all night, this pillow is so comfortable you hear it and just when you think I'll never, YOU ARE OUT. Not only am I falling asleep quickly, I was this close to buying sheet straps because I would toss and wake up 5 to 6 times a night. Now I wake up when the alarm goes off. And cool, I'm a real furnace and my head gets real hot as well, not anymore. As I read in a review I do recommend buying the king size for more buckwheat hulls and a standard pillow case for size, it's the size a standard pillow is when you buy it before you smash it while you sleep, except it doesn't crush, it cradles your head. And if your a forehead sleeper, occasionally I do, this pillow will mould to any shape you want, believe it. Hands down a great investment in the place you spend 1/3 of your life."

This model improves on the basic &#34;S&#34; shaped model by adding rods that provide leverage to really dig into those trigger points and hard to reach spots. The additional rods and nodes also enable self-massage of neck, arms, legs, and feet. You will never have to worry about describing a hard to reach spot on your back to a directionless fool again."

B00VQTOH7G,Smilebriter Teeth Gel Pens 60 Day Supply,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"This whitening pen is super easy to use.  Initially I turned the bottom part several times until the bleach reached the tip of the brush.  Then I simply put a thin layer on each tooth in my mouth. I turned the bottom of the pen a bit to get enough bleach for each tooth.  I also made sure to swipe between each tooth.  It only took a minute or two. The brush attachment is the easiest one I've ever used over the years.  It is soft, yet firm enough that applying is a piece of cake.  The instructions say to brush your teeth and floss before using, but I typically don't do that.  I just brush it on when I think of it about once a day.  You're not supposed to swallow it, but I don't see how that can be avoided to some extent.  About 20 minutes later, I rinse my mouth out and I'm done.  The taste isn't peppermint and one time I breathed in as I swiped a front tooth and it felt like I was breathing in weak ammonia.  But overall the taste is tolerable.  I have already been using another brand prior to getting this pen.  It is the CVS brand that comes in a container much like nail polish with a brush attached to the lid.  I like that one too, but this pen is much easier to use.  After 2 uses, I noticed a fairly significant whitening effect despite my prior daily use with the CVS stuff over the last month.  This leads me to believe the Smilebriter is a more effective bleaching option.  I'm very pleased with these pens (2) and once they are gone, I'll definitely order more."

B00LMEWGCI,"Balance Living Buckwheat Pillow, King Size",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Many years ago I purchased the Sobakawa Buckwheat pillow, and believe it or not I kept it for almost 15 years. I wound up having to buy two and make a king size pillow out of them because I couldn't find the king size version. When it came time to replace it I opted to go with the Sobakawa Cloud instead. What a mistake. I was warm all night, and the pillow was terribly uncomfortable.<br /><br />In comes the Balance Living Buckwheat Pillow 'KING SIZE'. I can't express how happy I am with this pillow. Have been sleeping on it for a week now, and it feels like my old friend. It does everything it says. I'm cool at night, and it cradles my head and neck so I don't wake up all achy. It conforms to me and not the other way around.<br /><br />Buckwheat pillows are a little noisy, but trust me, you will get used to it in short order and will not want to sleep on any other pillow ever again. I'm even thinking about buying a second one just for travel, since hotel pillows are the worst."

B00OSAUYTA,"Psoriasis & Eczema Cream 4oz Advanced Healing Non-Greasy Moisturizer with Organic Aloe Vera, Manuka Honey, Hemp Oil & More. Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Well, at first I was sort of lost. I tried many different moisturizers and they all just seemed burnt my face due to its hypersensitive irritation from topical retinoids prescribed by my dermatologist. Thus, I was stuck with red, painful, peeling skin, as a result, and it was NOT a fun experience.  I thought to myself &#34;why not try something natural to combat something unnatural?&#34; Because natural things might not cause all of this pain; and I swear if I put anymore chemicals on my face it was going to explode.. That's when I found this moisturizer. Just overnight, I noticed drastic changes in my chemically enduced flare ups and dryness. I was quite impressed, and my face was left supple and moisturized. As for application, it does go on sort of thick, what surprised me the most was how fast it absorbed; and it soaked in without leaving an oily/greasy residue (huge plus) a little DOES go a long way. I suggest using about a dime sized amount for your entire face, after washing with a sensitive Ph balanced cleanser that works for you. It really does work, and helps relieve the redness very quickly, and it leaves your skin perfectly moisturized! As for the owner, he is extremely motivated to create the best buying experience you can get; he is very prompt at replying, and is very resourceful! He will always make sure you're a happy costumer, so in my opinion no matter what, it's worth a try to get this moisturizer! If you don't like it for any reason, just message him and he will give you a full refund.  Best of luck to all those with sensitive skin! There is hope.  Jacob B."

B000J1VM84,Therapeutica Sleeping Pillows - Size Average - Medium,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have been owner of two of these pillows for several years and highly recommend them to all.  If properly sized this pillow works fantastic.<br /><br />Having suffered some neck issues after playing years of football in my earlier days, I found that normal pillows would ultimately lead to next day stiffness, aches and waking up with my arms being numb.  These can all be signs that your pillow, not your mattress needs to be addressed.  Being an experienced user of this product, I can say there was a bit of a learning curve in using this pillow, take several days to adjust to, and the biggest bit of advise I can give you is.....SIZE DOES MATTER!<br /><br />Although measuring according to Therapeutica's sizing guide for my first pillow, I found the first pillow did not work well for me on our normal pillow top, but worked GREAT on our firmer day bed that I will also sleep on.  See, the sizing guide does not factor in the depression of your shoulder/weight into your mattress which will affect your sizing.  For instance, I am 6'2&#34; 245 lbs.  I have to use a L for the softer pillow top and an XL for the firmer day bed mattress.  If they are switched, I know and feel it the next day.  So if you are one of those who order this pillow and notice noticeable issues over the first couple days, I would recommend you reevaluate/exchange for different size. For me, the softer mattress forced me to step down a size to get a proper fit that worked for me.<br /><br />For me, this pillow is the answer for a good night's sleep, however, it MUST be the right size."

I've normally avoided taking any kind of supplement and have instead opted to maintain a &#34;decent&#34;  diet and workout regiment when I can. As I've gotten older it's becoming more apparent that i need additional help. Something no man ever wants to admit. In come boostULTIMATE  It was a breeze to order and the product arrived at my home in a timely manner. I followed the directions randomly(mostly in the morning) taking 2 capsules a day. It was genuinely hard to tell if it was creating a difference in my energy output for the day. I think it was but wasn't really sure! Normally, I'm at my optimum in the mornings and start to dwindle shortly after lunch (1pm-4pm).  To get a better gauge of if the product worked or not. I decided to start taking it shortly after lunch. I noticed a small difference in energy level, mostly in not feeling as sleepy as i would normally around that time. Nothing crazy like bouncing off the wall. But a slight improvement. That in itself for someone like me with lots to do during the course of the day gets a NOD!  Thank you! Will try some of the other products for comparison."

I also could not wipe myself using this seat.  Thought it would be better than the old padded seat but it certainly was not.  I did like having the arms though and miss those."

B002PL33AQ,"Zephyr HxM BT Wireless Heart Rate Sensor, Black",Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"I received the unit 6/22/2015 and used it on three bike rides. It interfaced with Cyclometer version 1.0.4.7 using their heart rate monitor add in, and worked very well.  The only thing I had issues with is the chest band. It is one continuous loop, which I expanded to its maximum, and it barely fit around my chest! Yes I have a 48 inch chest, but the fact that it could not be &#34;unbuckled&#34;, or &#34;un snapped&#34;, was a problem for me.<br /><br />When preparing for the fourth bike ride, I noticed that the sensor was paired with my phone but was not sending heart rate information to Cyclometer. To verify that there was no problem with the phone apps I reinstalled Cyclometer, and I installed Caledos Heart app. Neither app would register the heart rate.  I reviewed the instructions for the Zephyr and made sure the chest band was wet, and the unit was fully charged. This did not solve the problem.<br /><br />I contacted the Zephyr Technology company and requested assistance, using their website on July 20th. on July 21st, Jackie Fournier responded with an email outlining all the steps I had taken before contacting the company, and none of the steps fixed my problem. On July 21st I requested an RMA. On July 22nd, Jackie responded with the requested RMA. I sent the unit back to Zephyr on July 26th, at the cost of $24.00.<br />Zephyr received the RMA on July 30th.<br /><br />I have been unable to communicate with the company since!  I have sent multiple messages requesting a status. Nothing. Nada. And today is August 12th!<br /><br />Be a wise consumer and reconsider your possible purchase."
B0000537JQ,Ezy Dose Weekly,Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"If I had seen these in person, I might not have bought them. The quality is not the greatest, and I feel like I overpaid. I am keeping them because I do need a bigger pillbox and it'd be a pain to return them. I'll use them while I look for something better. The size is really nice. I take several supplements and it holds them all with room to spare. The plastic is flimsy. Some of the lids are very hard to open, while others pop open with the slightest touch.

B00HES9CMS,"Viva Naturals #1 Best Selling Certified Organic Cacao Powder from Superior Criollo Beans, 1 LB Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this organic cacao during prime day. It was on sale so I decided to give it a try. I have known about cacao health benefits for a long time and in the past I bought some raw nibs from a health food store. They ended up tasting horrible and I threw them out. I was nervous about this powder but I have to say that I really enjoy it! It really smells like chocolate and provides a familiar chocolate taste to my protein shakes. It is easily mixable and blends perfectly in a high speed blender. It also gives me a nice boost of clean energy. I feel very energized focused about thirty minutes after drinking my shake when I add the cacao powder. I have recently been having some major hormonal issues and after reading many conflicting studies on the effects of cacao I am deciding to cut way back on my intake of the powder I bought. I've been putting about 2 tablespoons in my daily protein shake for a few weeks and I have had some strange onset of hormone disruption symptoms which I have never had in my life and I am young. I am in no way claiming that the cacao powder disrupts hormones, this is just a personal belief and I will be eliminating it to see if my symptoms go away. Otherwise, this cacao is awesome, the taste is great!"

B004O23YE4,doTERRA Cypress Essential Oil,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"doTerra DigestZen has been very helpful controlling ulcerative colitis for me.  It seems like I digest my food faster using this product.  I say so because I've found that when I get bloated, I end up being constipated.  Using this this product, I don't get bloated or constipated.  This product also relieves bloating that is present for me.  It also gets rid of stomach aches for me.  I use this topically with 3-5 drops being rubbed around the center of my abdomen area.  I believe it would be best if I used it daily as a regular routine but to be honest I just use it when I have bloating, a stomach ache or constipation.  I was very skeptical that essential oils would work as I've mainly relied on Western medicine for my ulcerative colitis.<br /><br />I would encourage you to buy this product - even if you think essential oils and Eastern-homeopathic treatments seem like &#34;hocus pocus&#34;.  You will be very surprised that they do indeed work.  I attribute this to essential oils being the purest form of natural medicine.  Our society didn't always have Walgreens or Norvatis and Pfizer to sell and manufacture western medication.  Before these amenities, natural remedies where passed down through generations and herbs and the like were gathered.  I'd say that &#34;witch doctors&#34; just knew what herbs to combine to produce remedies for ailments.  It's took bad they got a bad rap for using the resources of our earth to cure conditions of the human body."

I don't have any other proof that they work than my own personal experience.<br /><br />What you get is a small bottle that will fit into your purse or your pocket easily. It is amber in color to protect the oils inside. Inside this bottle are 100s of little tiny bead like pills. They are not bigger than a seed you might plant in your garden.<br /><br />I like to just let these roll around in my mouth or sit under my tongue until they dissolve. You can easily pop them by pushing them with your tongue into your teeth or roof of your mouth. If you do this be prepared for an intense burst of flavor. It is not a pepperminty flavor but rather it reminds both my husband and myself of cloves, almost as if we had bit into a clove.<br /><br />We use these and will continue to use them. Enjoy."

I love the smell of patchouli, but I know it is one of those scents that some people are overly sensitive to. When I smell the blend, both from the bottle and on my skin, I can just only make out the patchouli in it...but my mother and one of my co-workers, who are both the types that are overly sensitive to smells, are able to easy pick up on the patchouli and are bothered by it when I wear more than just a tiny bit.<br /><br />It does have aphrodisiac qualities to it if anyone is looking for that...."

I keep some in a shaker jar and add about 1 tablespoon to my morning smoothie (along with cashew milk, peanut flour and frozen banana - yum!). I have also used it in date fudge and it's delicious.

B00NU6H3PQ,Taylor Bluetooth Body Fat Smart Scale w/ 400 lb Capacity and SmarTrack App,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"The packaging for the Taylor scale is very nice looking with lots of information all over it about the scale.<br /><br />Inside you’ll find the scale packaged well with packaging material on the sides and then the scale is wrapped in plastic. You’ll also find the batteries and the user guide in there.<br /><br />The Taylor scale is made from tempered glass and it looks very nice. There are two metal strip on each side of the top of the scale and these are not for decoration, they’re actually capacitive sensors. To use the smart functions and get the most out of the scale you actually have to be barefoot with your feet on the sensors to get the correct measurements. It’s glass so it’s kind of heavy at about four pounds and it measures in at 11.8”x11.8”.<br />At the top center of the scale is the LCD display with touch sensitive button under it for various settings, the display measures 2” x 3”.<br /><br />The back or bottom of the scale has found rubber feet to make sure it stays in place and you’ll find some basic directions there as well.<br />The battery compartment is off to the top left side and it uses three AAA batteries for power which they do include for you.<br />At the top right side you’ll find a small button that is used for changing the units and for pairing Bluetooth.<br /><br />Usage/Testing:<br /><br />The display is large at 2”x3” but the actual weight doesn’t take up much space as the rest of the display is for the other functions and information. The numbers and letters are black and honestly I would rather have them a bit larger.<br /><br />The Taylor scale can be used just as a regular scale and you don’t even have to use all the Bluetooth and ‘smart’ functions, you can just weigh yourself and you’re done.<br /><br />I recently went to the doctors and their scale said I weighed 171lbs and my other digital scale said I weigh 171lbs as well and the Taylor scale says I weigh 170.8lbs. Yes the Taylor scale didn’t give me the same exact weight as my other scale, but all scales are different from what I’ve found. I think .2lbs difference is well within an acceptable margin of error,  either way .2lbs difference isn’t much and I can say the Taylor scale is accurate. 170.8 and 171lbs to me is close enough to call it accurate. I know the doctors scale is accurate, at least it’s supposed to be, and I probably had things in my pocket at the doctor as well.<br /><br />The Taylor scale is a smart scale with Bluetooth so if you really want to get the most out of it you need to use it with an iOS or Android device. I have Android so I downloaded the Taylor SmartTrack app to my HTC One M7 phone.<br />You’ll need to create an account and input some information like gender, birthday, body style, height, your goals and other basic stuff.<br /><br />Pairing the scale over Bluetooth was a bit tricky, it took me several times to get it paired but once it was paired it worked fine, it was just a bit frustrating at first. You need to make sure you read the directions, you really can’t just jump in and try pairing it.<br />Once connected there are a few options you can change like the units and the account paired with the app.<br /><br />The app itself has two modes essentially with several pages.<br />As I mentioned you need to be barefoot when using this scale, not sure I like that but whatever right?! The scale can measure weight, fat mass, muscle mass, body and show calories you should be eating.<br /><br />If you press each display you’ll then be taken to a graph so you can visually chart your progress for each category, this can be very handy for keeping track of you goals and overall health.<br /><br />The scale does allow you to have more than one person or accounts paired with it which is great for families of course.<br /><br />The Taylor Bluetooth Smart scale is a decent choice I think if you’re very much into fitness as it really can help you keep track of your goalsand help you work to attain them.<br /><br />We live in a very connected world and the scale can connect to your phone or tablet, iOS or Android, through the free Taylor app or you can use other popular fitness apps with it.<br /><br />The most important thing for a scale is accuracy and I would have to say the Taylor scale is accurate, it’s only .2lbs difference from my other other scale and that’s very much in an acceptable margin of error, .2 lbs isn’t much at all.<br /><br />The Taylor scale can offer a lot of information about your health and help you stay and/or get healthy.<br /><br />The only real complaints I could have about the Taylor scale is the numbers and letters on the display are a bit small, bigger would be better here. Bluetooth connection is a bit tricky, it took me a few times to get it paired.<br /><br />All in all it’s not a bad product, it’s very well made, it looks great and it can be very useful and helpful.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Seems accurate<br />+Looks very nice<br />+Lots of features and information<br />+Very well made<br />+Works with Taylor app and/or other popular fitness and health apps<br />+Works with iOS and Android<br />+Can be used as just a scale<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Bluetooth connection can be tricky<br />-Numbers are a bit small<br /><br />Please Note: I received this product for review for free/discounted in exchange for my unbiased reviewin a very connected world and the scale can connect to your phone or tablet, iOS or Android, through the free Taylor app or you can use other popular fitness apps with it.<br /><br />The most important thing for a scale is accuracy and I would have to say the Taylor scale is accurate, it’s only .2lbs difference from my other other scale and that’s very much in an acceptable margin of error, .2 lbs isn’t much at all.<br /><br />The Taylor scale can offer a lot of information about your health and help you stay and/or get healthy.<br /><br />The only real complaints I could have about the Taylor scale is the numbers and letters on the display are a bit small, bigger would be better here.

The day I got this in the mail I used this on my fiances back when he got off work and he absolutely loved it. He loved the way it felt and that I could apply as little or as much pressure as he wanted/needed instead of being stuck with just one pressure level. This massager stick definitely gets deep into the muscles and gives them a great massage. We both took turns with this massager stick and both really like the way it makes our muscles feel afterwards. This massager stick is very easy to use. It would be a great gift or you can just keep it for yourself! I would definitely recommend this Massager Stick!<br /><br />**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**

I was a little skeptical and debated on spending a lot more money on what I thought would be a better product but this one has worked great for her. She has already run the batteries down and had to replace them but that's no big deal. This one did come with batteries, instructions, a lanyard, and a little storage bag. It's easy for her to read and she is completely blind in one eye and partially blind in the other. I highly recommend this product."

It folds for efficient storage in the kitchen...or you can leave it full length, ready-to-use while lazing or confined in bed."

It will then display the temperature of the individual who's mouth it was just in. To turn it off, simply hold the button down. You can easily wipe it down with soap and water, wipes, etc.<br />This is really great for kids and adults alike because it's fast and simple! No longer do you have to try reading the lines on a mercury thermometer either because it's digital and it simply tells you the degrees!"

The mood/night lights are great too. It has several colors that it can cycle through or you can choose your favorite color.  Its super easy to use and clean. Twist it open, pour in your water using the provided pitcher, add some oils if you like, twist the lid back on and turn it on. Its that easy. This one produces a spread out larger mist compared to others that we have. I could smell the oil I added immediately. It has an auto turn off too which is nice. Fill it and forget it. When it gets low on water it will beep twice and turn off. For the price this has been a very nice diffuser for us.<br />I am giving the Ultrasonic Aromatherapy Diffuser by URPOWER a 5 star review. If you are looking for a large diffuser that won't break your bank then I would suggest you give this a try.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br /><br />I was provided with a sample for free or at a discount price in exchange for my honest review."

B001M29MFY,ahhNatural 1-year non-toxic hot tub water care kit,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have been using the ahhNatural system for 5 years. It might help that I am a chemist, so rather than give up when there were problems I tried to figure out why, and have the background to do so. I did call the folks at ahhNatural when I bought a new hottub and it was much harder to start up with this system than the 15 year old one that had been using toxic halogen soup. The old one I drained and flushed, and it didn't really have any issues staying beautiful and clear.<br />The new one...I finally got the company (mfr) to admit that they flushed them ( they have to leak test the thing before they ship them) with water and probably by the time I got it it had developed some bacterial issues. Had I used their toxic chemical soup to start up the new one, it would have been fine. But I didn't know, and the first fill rapidly was overcome by the crap in the new tub. I drained it, did a chlorine shock, drained it again, and refilled with a fresh bag, peroxide and salt.<br />This is a FABULOUS system. My skin feels soft and I can stay in the tub for an hour if I like and no wrinkled prune when I get out.<br />Whoever says it doesn't work didn't understand the chemistry and perhaps didn't get help or follow directions to fix it. I've found the company knowledgable and eager to help.<br />Get rid of the nasty toxic chemical soup in your tub and go NATURAL!<br />Oh, they do say if your tub has very heavy use or people who party in it without a shower first, it will likely need more peroxide and frequent filter changes. But don't let them use your tub."

B00H9L7VIW,"boostULTIMATE - 60 Capsules - Increase Workout Stamina, Muscle Size, Energy & More 1 Month Supply",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Excellent product, it has really helped me a lot in terms of long term muscle growth and testosterone levels. This product is more effective as long as you keep taking it everyday, otherwise don't except immediate results. It takes at least 2 to 3 months before you are start seeing any changes as your body has to get used to taking it. All of the ingredients are 100% natural, just do some research on each ingredient and it will surprise whats inside those pills. I would highly recommend that if you are taking these pills, you must exercise or at least workout otherwise you will gain just a tiny bit a weight, like maybe 15 pounds if that. I have been taking these for about a year now and have noticed some changes, my mind is sharper, my muscles are not as weak or sore as much, I am able to exercise longer then I used to, plus my erections last longer."

Unfortunately, these just don't work very well, possibly because they don't fit well either. I ended up stopping half way through and switching to my old blades which must be maybe five years old now, and they worked better than these. These kinds of blades are self-sharpening so as long as you clean them they'll still work reasonably well, though never quite as good as when they were new."

B00HES9CMS,"Viva Naturals #1 Best Selling Certified Organic Cacao Powder from Superior Criollo Beans, 1 LB Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I am by no means an expert, so I will only say a few things that I know to be true from my experience so far with this product. I have ordered several Viva Labs products and find them ALL to be of high quality. This cacao powder is a very fine powder that disappeared in seconds when I added it to my hot cocoa recipe in hot milk, but left a very thin, chalky feel in my mouth that wasn't offensive in any way-just noted. The taste is absolutely sinfully rich and actually made my plain oatmeal exciting again! I'm a diabetic looking for new ways to have my chocolate addiction satisfied without all the sugar, and am very excited about all the ways this will help. I tried stirring this into cold milk-it was a chore, or maybe a labor of love(?), but in time doable, and I enjoyed it, too! Some may call me crazy on that one! It blended well with a brownie recipe and made the baking aroma heavenly, and the taste was amazing with no residue left behind. I will do without before I ever bake another brownie with store Cocoa. Omitting the health benefits,this is a bakers dream ingredient! Including the health benefits, it's one of those &#34;having your cake and eating it, too&#34; moments in life!"

I heard a lot about aromatherapy and I really wanted to give it try. The URPOWER Ultrasonic Aromatherapy diffuser is such a life saver for me. It has so many features. 1st of all it takes 300 ml water which is more than other diffuser. It has light and mist button on the front. When you press light button once it will keep changing the color itself. If you press again the light button the same color will stays on. For mist you can set timer for 60 180 360  minutes or ON. It indicates with the green dot light which option has been chosen.<br />It comes with the cup to pour water, power cable, user manual and the diffuser.<br />It is was very easy and simple to use the diffuser.<br />Pour water and add few drops of your favorite essential oil. I use lavender as it works great for me. Put the top part back on and plug in the power cable.<br />If you can also light off the light if you want. It can also work as a night light while working as a diffuser. ( Do not turn it on without water to use as night light)<br />I use this diffuser in my bedroom at night and sleep peacefully. The mist from diffuser keeps purifies the air and I can easily breathe. The aromatherapy really helps to relief the stress and improves the immune system.<br />The user manual guides in detail how to clean the diffuser. Keep in mind for diffuser's life cleaning it weekly is recommended.<br />I am satisfied with its performance and durability.<br />I would highly recommend this diffuser.<br />I am so glad I got this diffuser on a promotion in exchange of an unbiased and honest opinion."

It definitely does its job which is to make your midsection sweat during your workout. I feel that it is a great asset to my workout and is helping me progress.

It came in a very generic box without any of the product verification it was supposed to have. I will come back in later and update this after I have used it awhile. My first impression is that it is well made. Time will tell. UPDATE #1:  I used this item with a DAMA vapor cartridge with a 510 thread.  On the lowest setting, I got lots of good vapor without it being harsh.  I'm updating to three stars for a good first use.  I will update again when I've had it awhile. UPDAATE #2:  It's broke.  Kaput!  I got two weeks of service from this device and then it just stopped working.  I recommend getting a different brand.  I'm downgrading to one star."

B010S4F5DE,"Weight Loss Belt-Belly Fat Belt and Waist Trimmer, 8in, Black, (Stomach Belt For Weight Loss)",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I honestly didn't have much expectation for this belt and would laugh at the absurdity of people actually thinking this could do anything for them. I was offered one to test and evaluate its efficiency and thought this was the perfect  opportunity to completely come out with how ridiculous they really are but after using it for 5 days now I have to bow my head and admit I was very wrong. I have lost almost a full inch off of my waist and I changed nothing about my diet or exercise other than wearing this belt. I put it on before work at 11a.m. and have been wearing it until dinnertime around 5:30 every evening. It actually hides well under clothes, you obviously can't wear tight fitting shirts and it be unnoticed but for casual fits you really can't tell. I like that It holds me snugly but I'm still able to move freely and handle my day to day responsibilities without being hindered by the belt. It does make you sweat but only inside the belt and doesn't give you gross sweat marks on your clothes. It is machine washable so won't get all stinky and nasty. I will say I'm impressed. My only issue was that it did roll up at the bottom over my hips but under pants with a good supporting closure (like jeans) it is kept flat. I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually WILL continue to use this belt and would even recommend it. I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after thorough testing."

B008S4PW6M,Norelco AT875 Deluxe AquaTec Rotary Razor,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Previously, I had a Norelco electric shaver.  I can't recall the exact model; but it was one of Norelco's better (and higher priced) models.  I was satisfied with it; and It lasted about 10 years.  When it failed, I searched a wide variety of brands and models; but, in the end, I decided to stay with Norelco and felt it was the best value.  I have had it now for about a month.  I believe that it actually gives a closer shave than my previous Norelco (which, admittedly, was overdue for new replacement heads).  I found that, after charging it, I was able to get 21 shaves before a recharge was required.  (It also seemed to take far less time to recharge than what was advertized.)  It can be used in the shower; so, you don't have to worry about getting it wet while cleaning it.  However, I found that after cleaning it (with water), you need to hold it in an upright position and shake it a bit to get the water out of it. Otherwise, when you pick it up, water will leak out of the bottom (where you would plug it in for recharging).  The Pop-Up Trimmer is a bit noisier than my previous Norelco, but not dramatically so.  I prefer a dry shave and do not use it with shaving gel and/or in the shower, so I cannot address that feature.  All in all, I'm quite pleased with it and would highly recommend it."

B00N5HD340,Straight Razor,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Always wanted to try straight razor shaving (as a DE safety razor user), and this was a cheap way for me to determine I was not into it.<br /><br />Because the blades are disposable and always sharp, I could put a new one in and reasonably rely upon that fact that cuts were probably due to my technique and not the blade.<br /><br />It's very hard to do straight razor shaving on yourself because the ANGLE is difficult to control without switching hands. Being very right-handed, I really couldn't do that. I bet I could shave someone else's face with it though.<br /><br />An immediate upside? Using a DE safety razor (slant edged even) seems SUPER safe now! I'm increased my speed with the DE due to that confidence, and I'd been using it for years now."

It was bad enough when I tested it 30 minutes after having one light beer that it registered as &#34;DANGEROUS&#34;...0.12 level.  However, the best example was when I tested it after brushing my teeth and had not consumed any alcohol at all and it registered as  &#34;DANGEROUS&#34;...0.16.  I had a friend at my house recently and I knew this person should not drive.  I tried to use this device to prove it to him and it would not work at all.  It kept registering bizarre crazy numbers that made no sense. Again, don't waste your money."

B00LMEW98O,"Balance Living Buckwheat Pillow Twin Size 20""x 26"", 100% Organic Cotton Cover",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I am a licensed massage therapist (15 years) and have been searching for the perfect pillow for myself and clients. I have tried all different pillow forms, materials and price ranges with sadly no success.<br />Did some research and purchased this one. For me there<br /> was a 2 night adjustment period. I shake the buckwheat to one end of pillow case and fold the case over to create a thicker sleeping surface for side lying support and now love the benefits of a better night of sleep.  Big benefit for me and husband; this disapates the pillow-head-heat build up for those of us living in the hot/humid south! Even better I gave it to my husband to test it out for a few nights and found his loud snoring has gone away! Now, I am purchasing another one for me. There is some noise from the buckwheat shifting when repositioning the head, but none that is bothersome for us. If you are a hyper -sensitive sleeper this may not be for you. Also I strongly suggest purchasing a lightly padded zippered pillow cover. Be advised this is not a soft fluffy material. The buckwheat hulls give a firm molded support to the the head, neck and shoulders. I am recommending this one (the travel or twin size only) to my clients with neck problems for the affordability and benefits of this product."
B006Z921ES,Power One Size 312 MERCURY FREE Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries),Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"Like in general, but too many duds in the package.  I have tried three different packages of 60 and each has had their fair share of dead batteries in them.  I'll probably try another brand next time I purchase batteries!  I have tried others, but I think battery makers seem to automatically through X<br />number of duds in the larger packs to get rid of their some of their rejects!  Sounds like bad business, but if they all do it, I guess no one gets the advantage."

Since I love drinking tea myself, I decided why not try teas that are formulated for weightloss? I was given a promo code to try and test BaeTea and I grabbed the opportunity.<br /><br />The taste as I mentioned earlier is very distinct. Personally, I think it is a hybrid of white tea and Senna Tea. Both of which are my favorite. That is why I enjoyed the flavor of this BaeTea. It is a bit &#34;spicy&#34; yet it has its own sweetness into it.<br /><br />I first tried the 14 day variety and I went through it so fast (in 7 days), and so I got this 28 day package. I truly love the flavor of this tea, and it makes me feel better whenever I finish a cup of it.<br /><br />The effects are really positive, I have the more urges to go to the bathroom and pee. I am feel less bloated, yet hydrated. My body feels lighter. I combine this tea with exercise and a weightloss supplement. I don't think this tea will help you lose weight if you dont help yourself to lose weight. You have to work and exercise for it to happen. This tea will work if you work.<br /><br />Overall I definitely love this tea, I love the taste and flavor. I will be trying their other variety of teas as this one impressed me. I purchased this using a promo code for testing."

B003U53RSE,Royal Massage Deluxe Universal Fleece Pad Sheet Set,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have a large table, not one of the smaller ones, it's extra wide and this fit perfectly!!! I love that it wraps around the entire table and not just a pad that lays on top. I used my new table and fleece pad at a massage class I took for my continuing education credit requirements and there were at least 20 people in the class, each brought their own massage table. In this 3 day class, it required that we switch partners around and every single person that lain on my table RAVED about how my table was the softest, most comfortable table in the group! The fleece is soft, and PLUSH! It fit the table well with no issues and as a therapist, when you lean into the table or have to stabilize yourself against it, it is so soft and comfy! Your hip or leg (depending on the height of the table) is very much well cushioned.<br />I LOVE it and so did all of the seasoned massage therapists in my class. Everyone was asking me where I bought it. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ONE!!!"

B00N5HD340,Straight Razor,Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"The folding piece that is supposed to hold the blade in place does not fit properly, which sometimes means that the blade flies off. When it does stay put and you use it, the huge gap between blade and holder gets filled with soap/hair and makes shaving very hard. I'm disappointed especially with all the good reviews this product has received - maybe I got a bad batch. Not worth 10 dollars."
B00ECV3XG6,Icetek Sports Folding Butterfly Flail Comb,Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"The screws unscrew themselves too quickly. Not very good as a comb, but maybe a novelty item. Screws strip fast. 2 stars."
B00HES9CMS,"Viva Naturals #1 Best Selling Certified Organic Cacao Powder from Superior Criollo Beans, 1 LB Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Delicious cocoa powder. I use in oatmeal with PB2 and monkfruit to make chocolatey peanut buttery goodness. It melts very nicely and tastes great. It is not instantized so you can't just stir it into milk, but a small amount in a blended protein shake is ok. A very good source of fiber and protein for a food flavoring."
B002C9MSAC,"OPTP PRO-ROLLER Soft Density Foam Roller - Durable Roller for Massage, Stretching, Fitness, Yoga and Pilates",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have one similar to this. However, mine is pretty hard for my back. Yours is a bit softer to use. It does help with occasional back pains.

I have in the past tried other floss picks and the others don't come close in comparison. Oral B Glide Floss picks are the perfect size and I like the squeezable handle for adjusting tension.

B00ZP79MHK,New bronze Doctor DR Who quartz Pocket Watch masters fob Timelord Seal MENs gift,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"This was a birthday gift for my 12 year old Whovian daughter.  She just opened it. It seems to be well made. Very heavy. She can't wear it for too long because it hurts her neck.  The chain is very long, but I think you can request a shorter chain when you order. We got the pendant 2 weeks sooner than I thought we would,  which was great since she got it in time for her birthday.  The galifreyen (?) design on the front is magnified by an acrylic bubble, which probably also protects the design from wear and tear. Overall,  we are happy.  She loves it. Only time will tell how well made it really is.<br />I recommend this for any Whovian."
B00S02EJZW,"Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush Engineered to deliver the Best Shave of Your Life!!! No Matter what method you use, Safety Razor, Double Edge Razor, Staight Razor or Shaving Razor, This is the Best Badger Brush!!!",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I'm new to shaving soaps, safety razors, etc. and this is my first shaving brush, so I don't have a good point of comparison. What I've observed with this brush is that, as a few other people have noted, a brownish colour bleeds into the shaving cream in the first few uses. Of course, I cleaned the brush before I used it. Also, I've been using the brush every day for a week and it's still losing a few hairs each shave. It's possible that I am being too aggressive with the brush though.<br /><br />If I am too aggressive, it's because the brush is quite soft and I am cursed with near-steel facial hair and sensitive skin. Getting the hair on my face to lift while trying to avoid overstimulating the skin on my face is a bit of a challenge with a brush as soft as this. That all said, the brush does its job and does not cause any discomfort.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice brush compared to the brushes I was able to find locally (which were either super-cheap or massively overpriced). Also, it's much much better than fingertips! I think a brush like this may be better for people with finer hair or young people who do not yet get a 5 o'clock shadow, however. I will probably try a boar hair brush next to see if that's more suitable."

B0006VJ6TO,Body Back Company’s Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Therapy Self Massage Tool - PARENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"A strange looking tool that feels awkward at first, but once you find the right orientation it gets pressure on spots I can't reach myself. I regularly use the parallel balls along the back of my neck while at my desk, but shoulders and lower back are frequent targets, and it even works for trigger points in my feet. My wife used it during pregancy to get to some uncomfortable spots that wouldn't release otherwise. You can apply targetted pressure almost anywhere with the right part of it, and it is big and solid enough to get good pressure on the spot without flexing.<br /><br />Nothing can replace a person with massage skills and willingness to use them, but when you need relief and don't have a helping hand, this is a respectable substitute. And it is held up for two years now, no concerns about durability here."

B000FZ3F20,Core Products Small Inflatable Lumbar Cushion - Blue,Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"This is a decent enough cushion. Though the delivery was somewhat slower than I would have preferred. Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I did not have an issue with the unit losing pressure. It seemed to work just fine and was comfortable... to a point. The thin layer of fabric over the top didn't contain the rubberized bladder underneath. So, on a hot day when you're driving you will have a tendency to get very sweaty when in contact with the cushion.<br /><br />A decent product for the price. But it might be worth considering a higher priced option."

B0006VJ6TO,Body Back Company’s Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Therapy Self Massage Tool - PARENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I seldom leave reviews for anything; I'm the type to get what I want use it and be done. However, I feel the need to write a review to anyone who has gone through hell and back with back pain.<br /><br />I've had two knots on each side of my back for months that have made it hard to sit or stand for long periods of time. I've gone to my chiropractor and a massage therapist, neither of which were really able to fully get to the knot and release it. The last massage I had, the massage therapist told me about getting a theracane to help with the tight muscles because not even she could get far enough down to reach the knots I had.<br /><br />Instead of a theracane I chose the Body Back Buddy. It's made of a very solid, well made heavy duty plastic that doesn't feel cheap or flimsy so I'm not afraid to lean into it or lay on pressure points. The most impressive thing for me was that after some maneuvering and finding which knob would work best, I instantly felt it hit a pressure point and release it. After using it religiously for 3 days, my back is probably 90% less tight, my knots have almost totally been loosened and I can walk further, longer and sit or stand for a longer period of time without the fear of having to find a chair to rest due to pain.<br /><br />It sounds corny but after living with pain for such a long time any relief at all is welcomed and I'm so glad I was able to stumble across this gadget to offer me relief without drugs or a huge expense. I plan on using it until my knots are totally gone and even then, will treat any that pop up in the future."

B00LMEWGCI,"Balance Living Buckwheat Pillow, King Size",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"AAA++ to these pillows!  I have been wanting to try these pillows for many years after reading about them and how they are the preferred pillow in Japan.  Finally decided to order one in a fit of boredom and my wife wanted to try one too so we ordered a pair.  When they arrived and I felt how heavy they are I was skeptical but decided to at the very least try them out for a couple of nights.  When you put your head on them or move your head they are somewhat noisy, sort of a crunching sound.  The sound is slightly alarming at first but honeslty not a big deal at all once you are situated.  In fact these pillows hold your neck and head EXACTLY how you settle in for the duration of your rest or until you readjust.  I have never had a pillow that does what these pillows do, boy do I wish I had tried one of these out years ago.  My wife agrees 100% about how much better her sleep has been with these pillows.  She has a bulging disc in her neck and finds that it is no longer uncomfortable to sleep on the tender side.  I have read where people have said these pillows are cooler, which is sort of true.  But closer to the truth is these pillows do not insulate or trap the heat from your head.  No more waking up to a sweaty pillow that you have to turn over or flip end to end."

I can travel with them and give my clients a nice sample of hot stone massage.  They heat up fast and clean up easily.  My clients are loving them.  It's not for a full  body massage but just enough for a back or neck sample.  Heavy cord and sturdy case.  Can't beat it for the price.  My only complaint is that it didn't come with an invoice or an option to buy additional stones, as they are custom to the unit."

B000FU107C,Medical Grade Vaginal Dilator Set,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I received these dilators less than a month ago. At first, I was hesitant to spend so much on something that I wasn't sure would work for me at all, but the ratings convinced me.<br /><br />Two years ago this October, I had vaginal reconstructive surgery due to a birth defect. Prior to this surgery, I was unable to use tampons or have a pelvic exam, let alone have sex. A q-tip inserted by my doctor was painful. My doctor performed the surgery and after healing, I was able to use tampons. However, after many failed, frustrating attempts of having sex with my ex, and lots of research, I realized that I had vaginismus. After my last relationship ended and I began dating the man I am with now, who was very loving and understanding about this, I decided I really needed to do something about this. I did my research and felt like these were the best. Prior to the dilators, I had only been able to have maybe an inch or two of penetration without being in incredible pain. I have worked with these dilators every day and slept with them in almost every night since July 8th. This product has changed my life! I was able to surpass the first dilator after the first few nights and gradually worked my way up to the fourth. I hadn't attempted the fifth, but wanted to see if I had made much progress. As of tonight, I now have an enjoyable sex life and no longer feel ashamed or different.<br /><br />So happy I purchased this product. It has been a life changer and I am so pleased with my results. Thank you!!!"

B010W0PM6E,Kanger Subox Mini Starter Kit - White,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"Ok, so I've owned this product for a few days. It has been around town and I needed to buy it due to not getting enough out of the smaller batteries.<br />This was my first &#34;mod&#34;.<br />My first puff on this device was WOW. Lots and LOTS of vapor and it hit was very strong. It even has a very warm vape, very much like a cigarette. Even using a menthol juice it was a warm hit.<br />If you are trying to quit smoking or need to upgrade from your current set up to a mod, this is what you need. It's 'simple' enough you won't break it too easily and the draw is perfect.<br />That being said, I don't know a lot about mods and I can honestly say looking at the thing I felt slightly lost but I went online and found reviews of the mod to find out what all I needed to do to rebuild the RBA. I actually burned out the 1.5 coil because I topped it out on 50wats right off the batt...newbie mistake. The product came with full instructions and told me what I did wrong. So make sure you read and research all the stuff about the mod before trying to use it. It comes with clear instructions, a white and black drip tip, all the thingsneeded for the RBA, a 1.5 and .5 head (the premade heating coils), and of course it came with the tank and the mod itself. The batteries are not included but aren't too expensive. I made the mistake of buying batteries AND a battery charger but this mod has a built in charging port. This means you place your battery in the mod and plug up the charge cord to your PC. The battery lasts me two days and I'm a heavy vaper.<br />My two big reasons I put only four stars: One, the battery cover is magnetized and does not line up perfectly. There's a tiny gap at the top of the battery cover (see photos). And TWO I've had this three days or so and haven't dropped the tank but magically a chip is already missing from the tank's white color (see photos).<br />But over all this mod is a rather good buy and does it's job well! For a beginner it's an awesome buy. It has some small issues but only comedic. When you look past that it does it's job and is a very s  mooth little device. I plan to purchase another one for my husband since he loves it as much as I do.<br /><br />Also a side note, I bought blue rings for my mod to jazz it up a bit and it turned out on the side there's a little window where you can see the battery so my battery was blue also and it all worked out together. But if your battery is a different color you don't want to show then the you're in luck because the mod comes with a sticker that is black to cover the battery so it wont shine through the battery window. The photos show where the window is.<br /><br />I have used kangertech products before and this is just another amazing product they offer!<br />I recommend it!t has some small issues but only comedic.

B0037LGS96,Schick Hydro 3 Cartridges 4 ea,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Five CLOSE Stars! Great shave with fewer blades in a smaller cartridge. Much like its ‘big brother’ Schick Hydro 5, this '3 blade-four cartridge' refill pack gives as good a shave as those 4 and 5 blade cartridges that make it feel like you are shaving with a billboard. This cartridge allows the user to get into tight corners and angles on the cheeks, chin, and neck. The cartridge characteristics are:  + it contains 3 ultra glide blades with 'skin guards' that smooth and protect the skin; + the `aloe' gel reservoir hydrates throughout the shave reducing friction; + the 3 blades are closely grouped to allow raising and cutting the hairs in the beard.  In testing, this 3 blade cartridge: + yields up to 4 weeks of use and a smooth shave each time with either gel or soap-based shaving cream; + the aloe gel system appears to work as well as the other Schick cartridges. + there is no separate, deployable trimmer on this model.  I'm a fan of the Schick two-blade cartridge, but this one is enough to make me change to the Hydro 3, promising 3 to 4 weeks of close shaves from the 4 cartridges. The price is right and  the blades are long-lasting. Highly Recommended. Five SHARP Stars (4 each Schick Hydro 3 Sensitive Refill Cartridges.)"

B0006VJ6TO,Body Back Company’s Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Therapy Self Massage Tool - PARENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Recently I had some really bad knots in my upper back and neck muscles.  It caused pain and numbness in my shoulders and arms so I finally sought out medical help went to physical therapy.  I use this tool along with my PT stretches, exercises and manual manipulations to help keep the pain and knots at bay.  I am amazed at how much tension is released from the muscles when I use this thing.<br /><br />I used it a little when I first received it and then set it aside.  Now that I know how to use it properly I use any time I feel the muscles in my neck tightening up.  I'm a little bit too round in the middle to use it for my lower back, but upper back, neck and shoulders works like a charm.<br /><br />I do feel this thing flex sometimes when I am really digging in to the muscles but it has held up great so far.  If I lost this or it was broken I would buy another in a heartbeat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this item."

B00NQ78CZO,Aloha Eyewear “Stone Creek MX1” Men’s Sports Wrap-Around Bifocal Reading Sunglasses,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"IMHO the Good:<br />Darker than usual lenses.<br />Nose and temple pieces that grip well.<br />Fashionable.<br />Bifocals that are not to intrusive.<br />Heavy duty.  Seem to be well made.  Should last a long time.<br /><br />IMHO the Bad:<br />The bifocals are lined and as such there are times when they can interrupt the flow of normal vision.<br />However, the bifocals are low enough that you are not apt to try and look over them.<br />A bit on the smallish side so look for a tight fit.  Hopefully they will stretch a bit over time.<br /><br />Would I buy them again.  Perhaps.  If they were &#34;no line&#34; readers, I would buy them again in a heart beat."

B00P8UDVWG,"HOMMP 7-Piece Nail Care Personal Manicure & Pedicure Set, 3-Pack (Brown lattice)",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Everything that you need is found within this apple-shaped manicure set, that is the absolute cutest. I got mine in green and feel that it is just the perfect color of spunk to get you in the mood to do your nails. Everything that you would need is found in the set. There is also a set of tweezers and a little hand held mirror that you could use to do your eyebrows -- even though it's not manicure related the eyebrows need to look gooooood! All the toys have a nice bit of weight to them, you're not feeling a cheap set, but it's also not the top of the line. To be doing your nails at home or getting them for your child/teen it's a great starter kit to get them into the familiar aspect of taking care of their nails. I randomly get a manicure and at times I feel that I could do it myself, but don't have all the tools. With this set I don't have to worry about not having the tools and can do them myself - and everything that I need is right here, within the apple! I did receive this at a discounted rate for my unbiased review. My opinion was not influenced by the discount that I received."

My only complaint is that you have to turn the dispense over to dump the pills out to reset the alarm & sometimes she doesn't remember to do that. I got the one with the solid color lid & think, perhaps, the clear lid might have been better as she still calls me to tell me she is out of pills even tho I've just refilled it. Or would it confuse her even more?"

It is scheduled to be here between the 4th and 7th.<br />It looks like a great product -- we shall see.<br />It is hard to find dual therapy units and I have high hopes for this one.<br />I will continue to update this review and provide comprehensive feedback along the way ...<br /><br />[Added Monday, Aug 3rd, 2015]<br />Wow! I was so surprised to see a text saying that my package was delivered already!<br />I opened the box and everything looked excellent -- including the box! lol<br />I would recommend this seller to anyone.<br /><br />So far, I am impressed and bumped the rating to 4 stars.<br /><br />I will be using it extensively over the next several days and re-post my findings.<br />I bought this for assistance with my back -- severely injured in the military (80% disability) and the muscles never healed correctly.<br />Consequently, I have had constant issues with my back going out on me and ongoing pain.<br />I was excited to find a unit that does both EMS and TENS.<br /><br />I'll post back again very soon...<br /><br />[Aug 6, 2015]<br />After three days of extensive use I have to give this product 5 stars!  The product is hight quality with lots of EMS/TENS options to choose from; intuitive in the layout -- takes just a little time time get used to which button to push to get what you want; the butterfly pads are very high quality and stick like crazy; the cords are long enough to reach everywhere from your waist; AND (one thing I was wondering about myself before I bought it) it is powerful enough that you do not have to &#34;crank it all the way up&#34; to feel it. I have seen others say that you need to have a 9 volt battery but this unit works great on the three supplied AAA batteries: Even on the least sensitive area of my body (spine, just below the waist) I stopped at 11 (out of 25).<br /><br />One word of advice: Don't keep turning it up right away -- sometimes the pattern you have chosen will get more intense as it progresses and you may find yourself grabbing for the unit in a hurry to turn it down! lol<br /><br />Overall, my experience has been 5 star - both with the unit itself as well as with the seller.<br />I can honestly highly recommend both.et more intense as it progresses and you may find yourself grabbing for the unit in a hurry to turn it down! lol<br /><br />Overall, my experience has been 5 star - both with the unit itself as well as with the seller.<br />I can honestly highly recommend both."

I was unable to verify due to 1/2 the Aspire sticker peeling off with the bar code label.<br />Next time I will purchase from a vendor that lists (a.k.a. understands the purpose) the sticker as a feature.

B00LMEW98O,"Balance Living Buckwheat Pillow Twin Size 20""x 26"", 100% Organic Cotton Cover",Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"Skip this pillow and buy the Sobakawa instead. I'll begin wtih the cons... 1. It's loud.  Loud enough to wake you in the night.  The filling makes noise, not truly a crackling noise, but a rustling of the fibers inside.  Annoying! 2. Super heavy.  I mean seriously, heavy.  That I can deal with, but not easy to deal with when repositioning it during the night.  which brings be to point 3... 3. Difficult to position, shape to fit your neck or whatever part of you that needs support.  Very difficult.  After fooling around with it for over 30 minutes, I literally threw it off the bed in frustration.  My cat began digging on it like it was a litter box, so I put it back up on the bed and decided to try again after my arms rested.  I'm 55 and have neck issues that has caused some numbness and loss of strength in my arms...probably a common problem for buyers of this pillow. 4. It feels like you're sleeping on a bag of yard work.  Which, in some ways, you are.  I've used buckwheat pillows before that were far superior to this.  I don't understand why it's so loud and feels just wrong.  Pros after getting it positioned, it does feel supportive for a few minutes, but sleeping on it all night???? Not going to happen.  I turn and have to reposition my pillow too many times to deal with this."

And the brass doesn't look perfectly shaped theres odd edges on it. It looks like it was not properly shaped.  Also there was a black  looking paint on the edge on the brass- where the brass frame meets the silver ring. It turns out it looks like its adhesive. But hey you get what you pay for  For the price, its pretty good.  The good news is that it does look like the photo very European,old ,fashionedand masculine ring But it doesn't look expensive and the gem looks kind of on  the fake side.  it feels good though.

B00J7G934C,"Oral-B Super Floss, Dental Floss, Original (50-count)",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"These make flossing with braces so much easier. I've had several that were severed by my teeth, so I'd give a 9/10 but I'm not sure that it functions any worse than floss of similar thickness. I used Crest thick floss prior to getting braces, but I will continue to purchase these until the braces come off.<br /><br />Anytime using floss with braces, one should take care not to pull the wire out with the floss. This doesn't help with that problem, look for picks for that. But it makes feeding the floss behind the wire nearly effortless."

I didn't really think much of it while looking at it on the website, but upon opening it I realized it's an actual well put together sturdy comb. The whole thing is steel and looks and feels like a real butterfly knife. I'm actually scared to get pulled over with this thing in my car it looks so legit! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because since the comb is actually steel, it can be a little rough if you're not careful while combing."

I hit the power button, and the the cape worked for about an hour. Then would not stay functional for more than 2 second. Tried to clean the coil, with no avail.  I returned the product to the seller the day after I received it. Awaiting a refund. That being said, I will order another one, Not all will be defective.  It has great features and is sleek and easy to use. Comes with instructions, but no batteries. You need to purchase batteries when you purchase the subox. I gave it 2 starts because it was defective and the seller didn't respond after I emailed. I had to contact Amazon in order to get the seller just to ask if I already returned it and why, I thought the product was unsatisfactory, I replied. The seller did not follow up. Hoping for a refund and, I will purchase another subox   update...   Got a new subox. Black addition. Works great... Love it.    Went to a different buyer.    This seller has not furnished a refund as of yet. His product was indeed defective, couldn't even unscrew the the bigger coil to thread the cotton. With the new one no such problem.

I have another, similar adjustable voltage battery and wanted a second as a backup.  It worked just fine for a couple of weeks, but I noticed it was stronger than my other one when on supposedly the same setting.  Then all of a sudden, every time I use it, I get maybe 2 good puffs and then this overwhelmingly awful taste and smell like someone is setting plastic and electronics on fire.  Tried with 4 different tanks, brand new coils, 2 different juices and compared to 3 other batteries to figure out what was going on.  It is definitely the battery.  Local shop thinks it's a cheap knockoff.  Should have known when it was less than half the price of the similar one I have."

B00K5088RW,"Syrtenty 2"" x 4"" Rectangular Electrodes - Multiple Quantity Options",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,I am using these pads with an EMPI unit successfully.  I like the fact that the wires are embedded deeply into the pad instead of just inserted in the edge as some brands do.  This should improve the overall life of the pad.  The cloth outer covering is also a plus.  They seem to conduct the electric impulse as well as the brand that came with the unit.  If they continue to perform well I will reorder these pads in the future.

B00N5HD340,Straight Razor,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"Excellent weight, holds the blade tightly, very easy to use (although I did have to work it in a little bit to operate smoothly, but after the first day, it was perfect). Construction feels solid. It's not a real straight razor, nor should it be expected to be in terms of comfort and quality, so the rating is given exclusively on its own merit. The only downside for me is the blade exposure - not quite enough for me, though that's fixed by changing up my grip a bit. Blades were a 4 rating for me - not my favorites, but certainly not bad. I am accustomed to Red Personnas when using a double-edge, but an 8000 grit edge on a straight, so the Derbys are right in between for sharpness, and just a bit harsher than both.<br /><br />5 stars for convenience, 4 for operability, 4 for shave quality. Overall, would definitely buy again."

First off all the ingredients are natural no side effects. I take 2 pills a day one in the morning with my breakfast and one at night after my dinner. I have long busy days, I start off at 4 AM and then I go to GYM at 6 PM and spend 2 to 2 1/2 hrs with some crazy workouts and BOOST ULTIMATE has helped me go through that workouts with out any issue and my body has changed a lot. With the help of BOOST ULTIMATE I still have lots of energy left for my LOVING WIFE and she is like you are always horny. This is a little extra information but want to share it, during the day time I do get some crazy hard on and its heard to control it in the office, especially when i am in a meeting. Over all good product and defiantly recommend it to my friends and family members."

B00OSAUYTA,"Psoriasis & Eczema Cream 4oz Advanced Healing Non-Greasy Moisturizer with Organic Aloe Vera, Manuka Honey, Hemp Oil & More. Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"Unfortunately this product does not work for my psoriasis.  This is the second product I've tried that contains aloe, and both have had the same effect of growing skin too rapidly before the treatment has a chance to heal the skin properly.  About a week in, I had spots on my left hand that began to itch where I haven't had psoriasis for years .  So if you have a similar effect to other aloe-containing products steer clear.  However, this product is an excellent facial cream, but it's not enough for me to warrant keeping it and I've requested a refund.<br /><br />I am (and have been) using MetaDerm Organic Hyper-Moisturizing Cream instead with excellent results.  Era Organics also sells this wonderful product.<br />My routine consists of using a straight razor twice a week to remove dead skin after a shower, then using pine tar soap (I've heard black soap works great as well) combined with a microplane/rasp twice daily, then moisturizing with Metaderm.  This, along with ~4000IU of vitamin D daily, plenty of sunlight, and a healthy diet keeps my condition under control and barely visible.<br /><br />***update 8/30/15***<br /><br />As soon as this was posted, Tyler (the company's owner) emailed me with some suggestions, such as only using Dr. Bronner's soap and other more natural pH skin restoring products, and that to use the Era cream as much as I needed.  I decided to try another month, and although the condition was improving, after I ran out of the cream I switched back to MetaDerm Hyper (still using Dr. Bronner's), and I now am using less product (2-3 applications daily rather than 4+ with Era) and don't have to remove as much skin.  Nonetheless, this product is worth trying and the customer service has been excellent, so I've increased my rating by one star."

B00840296G,ResMed ClimateLine Heated Tubing,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Somehow the tubing that came with my CPAP got stretched out near the end and developed a tiny little air leak. Of course, with a CPAP, the accurate pressure is incredibly important. When I contacted the company that leases the machine, I was SHOCKED at how much they wanted for that tube... and the fact that insurance would not cover it's replacement. Apparently it's a &#34;once a year&#34; type thing. Who knew?!<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find this tube, identical to the one I had, here on Amazon for about half the price. It attaches to the machine and the CPAP recognizes it as a ResMed product, so it regulates the temperature and humidity perfectly. That is the great thing about this heated tubing, no more condensation and being blown in the face by that moisture... I used to hate that! Sound asleep and suddenly you think you're drowning!! No issues like that with this tubing, it does what it is supposed to and it is much more economical than any other place I could find."

Not as comfortable as the similar APEX, but the APEX break (again, big head) after one year, almost to the day (this has happened for 2 pairs).

B000W23BSY,Hookah Mouthtips - Mouth Tips / 100 Pieces,Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"Didn't receive 100 as advertised, although I wasn't sent the ones advertised to begin with anyway. They came in assorted colors and I understand that isn't the biggest deal, but that's not what I intended to buy. It's a bit misleading, although they do fit the hookah hose. Due to the fact that I just kind of received what they felt like sending, I'm not sure what I would get a second time, so I unfortunately will not be ordering again."

B000NIFVM6,"Serola Sacroiliac Belt, Small hip up to 34-Inch",Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"This belt does provide relief for my sciatic nerve. What isn't great is that I've worn it less than a week, and not constantly (mainly for relief when sleeping or longer walking trips), and the edges of the elastic are already curling very badly. I'll post back in a month or so to update how it's wearing, but it's not off to a great start from a durability standpoint."

B0000537JQ,Ezy Dose Weekly,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I should have paid attention when purchasing, because this is pretty big. I think a quarter would easily fit into each slot and have a good bit of room on the bottom.<br /><br />Only reason it didn't get five stars is that the fit may, in fact, be TOO tight on the snaps. I have to give it a little umph, so I can't imagine what that pressure would do to more fragile skin."

B00DGFHBJO,Omron Pmllpad Electrotherapy Long Life Pads,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,Words cannot describe the greatness of this product.  I have painful arthritis in my knees which kept me up at night and limping during the day.  My daughter gave this to me and said she thought this little machine would help.  I was doubtful but was willing to try anything at this point.  Within 24 hours after using this several times the pain greatly decreased to the point I could sleep on my side for the first time in months.  I use it for a couple of hours in the morning and at night.  There is still some discomfort but nothing like before using this.  I very much recommend this for knee pain and if you know someone who has fibromyalgia please get this product to greatly lessen your pain.
B00H9L7VIW,"boostULTIMATE - 60 Capsules - Increase Workout Stamina, Muscle Size, Energy & More 1 Month Supply",Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"I tried it and it's not bad, but, it's not the best in the market.

I can honestly say I have witnessed growth, and it makes me feel incredible. I would recommend following the directions really closely, however. They are not joking when they tell you to eat before taking these. Otherwise your heart will race quite a bit and it gets kind of frightening, but this is totally avoidable by following the directions on the bottle.<br />This company is also incredible and gives you a free bottle for reviewing their products, and doesn't even require a &#34;good&#34; review for that to happen."

B00P8UDVWG,"HOMMP 7-Piece Nail Care Personal Manicure & Pedicure Set, 3-Pack (Brown lattice)",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I am always looking for a good manicure set because between my daughter and I we are always loosing something and needing something badly for our nails.<br />This came in the mail and I was so happy to see the cute holder that everything comes in. I mean really how cute is a apple case with all your manicure items inside?? I love it and so does my 17 year old daughter:) I opened it up and was afraid at first of messing up the apple, but it is pretty strong and I had to get into everything. My favorite items are the nail clippers. You get two different styles in this set and if anyone loves there nail clippers it is me. I always seem to loose a pair lol. That isn't the only thing that comes in this set. You get everything you need to take care of your nails. I mean really this is the perfect set!!! Everything is not dull like most sets that you get,there sharp and ready to be used.<br />For me though, my daughter has kidnapped this from me,so I am going to sneak back in her room tomorrow while she is at work and take it back lol. The top of the apple that comes apart goes right back on and back to the perfect apple shape that it was before:) I can not say anything bad about this Manicure set. I do highly recommend it and the price is perfect for it.<br />I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased feedback and that is exactly what I have done. I love it!!!"

B00H9L7VIW,"boostULTIMATE - 60 Capsules - Increase Workout Stamina, Muscle Size, Energy & More 1 Month Supply",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I've taken many testosterone supplements. I am a 55 year old gym rat. I've been lifting and playing raquetball (cardio) for 35 years. I've used testosterone shots from the Dr at $500 a month to achieve test levels to that of a much younger man, but it just got too expensive to maintain. Also if your familiar with how test works in your body after a shot my levels increased dramatically. but it cycles through your system in 6-7 days. The problems is not just the expense but also receiving shots every 2 weeks like most Dr's recommend. It means your playing your system like aYo-Yo. Up one week down another. Feeling great half the time and sluggish and lazy the other. My wife notices the difference big time in the bedroom. I've also tried many over the counter testosterone boosters. I've had decent results with most but not quite the same as those injections. I've been desperate to  find a test booster that allows me to grow and maintain not only my muscle size but also in the bedroom as well, without the expense and the up and downs associated with test injections. Well everything has changed for me after discovering Boost Ultimate.it is by far the strongest most potent test booster I've ever used. If you have never tried Boost Ultimate I highly recommend you do now! The feeling of strength, energy, and the desire to make love to my wife reminds me of when we 1st got married. No more up and downs (except bedroom) for me. I can achieve and maintain my test levels without the tremendous cost associated."

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"I bought this for my 3 year old because she has pretty severe eczema that will not clear up with prescription steroid and/or barrier treatment. After spending tons of money at the dermatologist, I decided to go natural and bought a variety of creams and such. I went with this one because of how expensive it is ( if it's expensive it's got to be good, right?) unfortunately, this particular cream did absolutely nothing for her skin. I used it twice a day for one week and each time I applied it she scream &#34;owwwwieee!!!&#34; I am guessing it hurt her because she doesn't do this with any other lotion or medication I use on her. Her skin was reddened after application so maybe she was allergic to something in it? I used it on myself and didn't notice anything beneficial nor harmful. It did not seem very moisturizing, however. For now, my family will stick to pure organic ivory Shea butter, which works best for us and is non-irritating. I will give this to my friend who suffers from mild psoriasis. Hopefully she will have better luck."

I have several health issues that make it essential to avoid chemical toxins as much as possible (including MTHFR). While this works ok. it is not as comfortable to apply as some of my other natural deodorants. It is hard and rough and just doesn't apply well for me, even when slightly damp from the shower.<br /><br />It is somewhat pricey for what it is, but it does last an incredibly long time. Unfortunately, I used the small stick a couple of time in between my toes and the darn thing broke, rendering it virtually useless. It's a great thought, perhaps a poor execution... or maybe I got a dud, I am not sure. I definitely do not reach for this one like my others, and I wished I had realized that before I spent so much on the set."

The buckwheat husks are a bit crunchy, so it's noisy when I adjust it around my head.  But there's no noticeable noise once I settle in.  You shape it into the position which relieves the weight of your head from your neck. It has solved all my neck pain from typical pillows.  The pillowcase is zippered, 100% cotton.  No other protective case.  I strongly recommend covering it with a moisture proof pillow cover, otherwise it will get damp, and you'll need to empty out the buckwheat husks to wash the case!"

I'm sure a high-end, pure sweet almond oil would be out of my price range for this size!  It's not the best, but for the price it does the trick!

Only reason it's 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'm not crazy about the face lotion. It kind of stays on top of my skin and peels into weird clumps when I try to put make up on after it, even if I wait a while for it to dry.  The little roller tube of oils lasts for SO long (probably 4-6 months...I'm two months in and have barely made a dent in it with regular use)."

B00WTNA7EK,"Massage Bar, Muscle Roller Massager Stick - ClubFit Sports Gear",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"This stick is essentially designed to operate on the same principle as the more traditional foam rollers. It serves to massage the muscle tissues of athletes and people who just want to stay in shape. The only difference is the size and shape of the object.<br /><br />Of course, because it varies in shape from ordinary foam rollers, it can’t be used in exactly the same way either. Normal foam rollers require one to lie down on the floor and move their body in specific ways so that the roller is rolling beneath them. There are several types of these rolling exercises but pretty much all of them are performed on the floor. The stick helped  immensely with my calves, I work and sit and walk up and down stairs. I was happy to have this, massage stick to ease the pain.Disclaimer: I received a free or discounted product in exchange for your review."

B00128LKGC,Roho Airhawk Truck Comfort Cushion,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I've purchased 5 of these so far.  They ship it with a repair kit.  Keep that repair kit handy, as you will need it.  Just submerge the plastic cushion in your tub, then put your fingers over the bubbles, dry it well, then put one of the patches that comes with it on the spot where the bubbles were coming from, usually at the base of an individual cell.  You need to be careful to make sure the clear patch is completely flush with the bend of the cell.  It usually holds for another month or so.<br /><br /> The cushion though saves my rear, legs, and back, but they don't last very long for me.  But at about $20 a month vs. being off on disability, is a no brainer.  I've used so many different cushions, and none come close to the relief I get from this cushion.<br /><br />I also have purchased two for my bike, after the first one failed during a 4,000 mile trip, I had one overnighted to my hotel.  I only rode about 100 miles after it went flat, but that was enough for me to overnight one before continuing my trip."

I had surgery on one and my other one i have hurt a couple times. If you have bad shoulders, you know there's those spots you cannot reach but it hurts. The back buddy definitely changes that! it will rub out all those knots and the pains that need to rubbed out! On the other hand the ball, I don't really use it too much. It's a little more painful than relieving. Back buddy go get it!"

B00SV99MZ6,Clone-a-willy Glow in the Dark Kit,Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"My girlfriend wanted me to buy this, so i did. When i got it my girlfriend and i read the instructions several times. When we mixed the plaster mold of coarse we got the water to the right temp and stured for sixty secounds, like it says on the instructions. the mold got hard within 20-30 seconds after we poored the mold into the molding cylinder. It wasnt enough time to get my willy in place. So i ordered some more molding plaster from the &#34;clone a willy&#34; website. the secound time we stured the molding quickly in 20 seconds at the rite water temp. It gave me enough time to get my willy in the cylinder. But this time my tip of my willy and the shaft closer to my body was touching the sides of the cylinder. I have what &#34;clone a willy&#34; calls a crooked willy. Their is a extra step you have to do to the cylinder to accommodate for your willys curve. (you can find the extra step on cloneawilly.com) So I ordered some more plaster and made the changes I needed to do to the cylinder and the third time is the charm."

I have had good success in the past using pure tongkat ali but those results, over time, began to lag. Though using the recommended dosage and taking the suggested time off (to prevent developing a tolerance), the zip began to fade. Then I discovered boostUltimate! It contained not only tongkat but also synergistic ingredients. It is this combination which I give credit for getting the juices all fired up again! I'm in my 50's and can outperform men half my age (name the activity).  I credit boostUltimate, in no small way, for this."
B0002JG2NI,Home Health Castor Oil,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"One of my favorite oils in my collection. I sometimes mix this oil with almond oil,coconut oil, and grapeseed oil. I use it on my body and in my hair for a treatment/itchy scalp. It does not smell bad at all and has a light smell that is not overpowering like Jamaican Black Castor Oil. It will last you a while if you choose to buy it again. I highly recommend this oil if you trying to grow long thick eyelashes, get rid of eyelash dandruff, have smooth soft skin, increase hair growth,and to grow back your edges a little bit thicker. Being consistent applying this oil is the key to see results. Start off using a pea size of the oil when applying."

B00V2L5JRA,Xtreme Comforts Coccyx Orthopedic Comfort Memory Foam Seat Cushion,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"This is very high quality, but I can't say it increases my comfort. It's large, firm, and well sculpted. The outer cover is a nice black padded breathable mesh, and it zips open to reveal a dense memory foam interior in a soft cover. Solid construction, easy to clean, and seems like it will hold up to regular use. It even looks slick!<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me, it really didn't do anything to increase my sitting comfort. I was just as sore or more so after a day on this as I am in my regular office chair. But given that there are many reviewers who did get results and that there is a money back guarantee, I wouldn't warn anyone away. It's unquestionably a quality product, just not one that worked for my body.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.

Glasses have several great qualities. They are not Polarized so you don't have to worry about distortion when you view a cell phone screen, watch screen, etc. Frames are matte black and lenses seem to be good quality and almost glass-like. There are no irritating logos on the sides or gaudy decals/decorations. They do not come with a case but they do come with a microfiber cleaning rag. Hinges are stainless steel looking and are spring loaded and seem durable. Bifocal at bottom of lens does not span totally across the bottom but doesn't seem to be an issue.  Unfortunately, most sunglasses either fail at the hinges, lenses fall out from cleaning or some other defect. These seem like they might have a chance being more durable.

I appreciate that you need a bit of heft to make a quality (read: solidly-built) massage tool, but I wish this could be advertised more clearly. Can't please everyone after all.<br /><br />2) Storage can be an issue - Should you hook it by your clothes rack, and let its awkward s-shape swing away - and possibly drop on the head of a crawling infant? Or lay it down flat somewhere - where it'll take up a big surface area? Again, I must stress that I'm nitpicking."

I have tried almost every cream in the market, and ended up with the fluocinonide cream prescribed by my doctor. So I won't blame this cream, maybe it just does not work on me. I have partial eczema on few of my fingers, so probably it is not caused by what I ate, but by over use of hand wash or detergent on my hand.<br /><br />The texture of the cream is okay, not too greasy, but I don't like the smell of it (Just my personal preference). I tried putting it on three times a day and a thick layer before I go to bad and wear cotton gloves, still, not much improvement :(  It does stop the itchiness, but does not help with the cracking at all. So if you have a really serious eczema, I would recommend some healing ointment instead.<br /><br />Again, this is just not for me, but maybe it will work for you."

B00V2L5JRA,Xtreme Comforts Coccyx Orthopedic Comfort Memory Foam Seat Cushion,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I bought this for my husband because he works in front of the computer more than 11 hours a day on average. Sometimes he sits on the chair for over 13hours a day. the back pain is getting serious and we tried so many things to reduce his lower back pain. Nothing really helped or they only seems to reduce the pain temporarily. we tried multiple types of sprays, oil to reduce joint and muscle pain, hot and cold pads, electronic massager, manual roller, and joint supplement. None of them seems to work. After I bought this seat cushion, he brought it to his office so he sits comfortably as well as adjusting his sitting position with the curves of this cushion, the lower back pain seems to get better and the blood circulation is improving on both of his legs too.<br />This product is very well made. The quality looks great and the fabric feels really nice and sturdy. The fabric looks very breathable and it can be taken off and washed in the washer. I know there are other similar products sold on Amazon this one so far it's the best quality I have seen. This is a great investment if you or your loved ones sit most of the times during the day. It can be a great birthday gift, father'day or mothers 'day or Christmas gift ideas. Five stars!<br />I got this product in exchange of my honest customer review. This review is based on my own after testing this product out for a period of time."

When I first opened the package it seemed odd - heavy and crackly.  On the bed however it is very comfortable.  I can bunch it up under my neck and head 'just the way I like it'.  It is a little noisy when I first lay down but after that I don't notice the  cracking noise at all.  For people who need a pillow that they can 'arrange' the way it is comfortable for them this is a great product.<br />For me the pillow is big and I may reduce it by emptying out some the buckwheat.  That doesn't seem like a difficult task at all.  I mention it as others may like the big pillow.

I don't remember how so I may have not done a proper clean up. On the product it says to wash the area of the spill. Anyway, I set it beside my bed. I had an oscilating fan blowing over it about 5 feet away. I don't remember the condition of the environment of my room, i.e. whether the A/C was on or if I had left the window open or if the window was closed and no a/c. I also live in a humid area with temps up to 90 fehrenheit.<br />I leave for a vacation for a few weeks and then return to find that my whole apartment is toxic. The items in my room stink of this sour odor; my watch, my weights, etc. is stinky. Everything was contaminated. When I go to take a shower my nose is burning, my eyes, and it probably irritated my esophagus, but I'll go into this later. So I immedietely throw away ALL my stuff, including furniture. I go to live with someone else and turn the A/C on as simply opening the windows did not help a bit. I later vigorously  cleaned the carpet with a water vacuum. My aparentment was inhabitable for a long while.<br />I had called Damprid support and spoke with them about the smells and my problems, but they acted stupid. They told me &#34;it's just a salt&#34;. Seriously? Are they so stupid that they don't know calcium chloride is a dangerous chemical? You can't even touch this stuff and if you do you have to wash your hands really, really well. It's not &#34;just a salt&#34;. It should have more warnings so people take more care to clean spills very, very well and not to touch this stuff, and by all means AVOID it in rooms with fans. But it doesn't look like Damprid cares. Just another uncaring business.<br />So to everyone using this stuff, please don't make the mistakes I made. I did fully recover from my symptoms but I'm not sure my esophagus is what it was before as I had lots of burning."

B0006VJ6TO,Body Back Company’s Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Therapy Self Massage Tool - PARENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have had chronic back pain since my twenties. I've tried many other tools, including the ones from sports stores. I just opened my Back Buddy & I loved it within seconds. Here's why:<br />- I can use this myself. I do not have to rely on someone else to massage my back.<br />- I can apply it directly to the spot I want<br />- I control the pressure<br />- it's light weight<br />- works on my entire body<br /><br />The only con I have (this is me searching for a con) is it is large. I would feel very awkward using at work (open cubicles). You can travel with it, but only if you have a large suitcase.<br />Re: size- I am 5'0&#34;. This size works fine for me. It's not too big. I may purchase the smaller version or the cane for work."

B001PFNVW8,My First Year Baby Frame,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"frame is as described and price was reasonable . I bought it for my newborn to match the one given to his brother three years ago.  I like it because I have space for pics from one day old to 12 months. I feel that the size of the holes are adequate. The key to having the baby's head not take up the entire circle is to take the pics two or three feet away. That way, you get to see baby's head and neck, maybe even the shoulders. Passport pics and wallet size are a good example, but a 4x6 will work if pic isnt close up. The white finish doesn't bother me because the one I have is white. If I have another child I'd get another."

The bifocal lens doesn't seem to be in quite the right place for me ... but it's close enough for occasional or outdoor use, and otherwise the quality seems just fine. I think if you really wanted permanent bifocal readers your best bet would be to get measured, etc. These aren't bad at all, they're just not exactly perfect for me."

B00H9L7VIW,"boostULTIMATE - 60 Capsules - Increase Workout Stamina, Muscle Size, Energy & More 1 Month Supply",Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"I lift 5 days a week that includes high intensity interval training (HIIT) and I decided to add this into my supplement stack to see if I could notice an increase in strength/size. I didn't notice any strength increases, however, I noticed that my muscles seemed &#34;fuller&#34; but only after 3 weeks of taking 2 pills a day (morning and after dinner). I didn't notice a change in my libido whatsoever but I don't have issues with it either. It gave me bad nightmares the first couple of days I took it, but I stopped getting them about 3/4 of the way through the bottle. I also experienced slight headaches the first time I took it.<br /><br />Overall, it didn't do a whole lot for me, especially not like the other reviews (I presume are mostly fake) claim. It made my muscles look fuller, but it's not worth the price or side effects to get it again."

I even moistened the adhesive. Sometimes when a pad loses it tack you cant add a drop of water to revitalize it. But not on these pads. They are either old and past their prime or just poor quality.

B008S4PW6M,Norelco AT875 Deluxe AquaTec Rotary Razor,Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"Actually, it works fine.<br />Here's the problem:  There are very few choices for electric razors.  If you look only at rotary blades there are even fewer choices.. I avoid the other type, foil shavers, because they are too difficult to clean and too easy to damage.  So there aren't too many choices for rotary blades.  These Phillips-Norelco razors work great - until they don't.  When they don't, it is because the on-off switch fails.  Yeah, you can turn them on & off with a paper clip - sometimes - after the switch breaks - but not all the time. Mine last up to 18 months until the switch fails. That's not too bad; by then you might want to replace the blades which cost almost as much as the whole razor.  But it's a bit annoying."

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,oh yea this stuff is healing - very good stuff - I LOVE it.  I have rosceaca and eczema/psoriasis - sometimes I have welts on my face due to these conditions - this stuff is very healing and I have not had welts since using it.  I have gone thru almost 100 bucks trying to find the right thing - this is it.  I also use a sun screen and mixed it in a smaller jar - one shade of sun screen for some seasons and another shade for other seasons.  I will in addition to this purchase a separate aging cream as I am old.  so if you are going broke and crazy trying to calm you skin I highly recommend Era Organics &#34;Eczema & Psoriasis&#34; cream ;) ps I was not paid for this review.

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I've been using this product for about 4 months and it has completely changed my life. I am 31, and have been battling eczema for over 15 years now.  While many, many other creams tend to stop working after a week or two, this magical elixir has been added as the final stage of my hygiene routine and over time, the itch is gone. My skin now thirsts for this cream as soon as I towel myself off after the shower, it almost demands it. The cream feels silky in my hand, it's incredibly non-greasy, and smells fantastic to me. I know others didn't like the scent, but it reminds me of a cocoa butter mixed semi-sweet chocolate scents. It doesn't leave the skin greasy or dry at all after it is applied, it is absorbed within 10 minutes and leaves my skin with a cool, refreshing feeling. If you love the feeling of your mouth after brushing your teeth, you will love the way your skin feels cool and refreshed. I waited a few months before glowing about this product, but I don't think it's going to stop working any time soon. I thank Era Organics for making this product, it truly has made my daily life so much better, without the itching, burning, and random skin blemishes for years and years. I plan on using this product indefinitely, it is my favorite cream I've ever purchased."

In my situation, it works only with 4 capsules per day. Now we are talking results.My third review after consuming my second bottle and on the third bottle now of this product.

I jumped at the chance to purchase this at discount in exchange for honest review.  This is a product I can use on my clients as well as myself so I am thrilled!  After being on my feet all day I simply take a seat and place my feet on this roller and let it do its magic.  The individual spinning rollers have nubs that grab and cover all pressure points in my feet.  As a therapist, I am always telling my clients the benefits of having work done on their feet. Your feet are like a map of your entire body to a therapist.  There are so many physical, emotional, and mental benefits with massage and trigger point (or pressure point) release.  For my clients, this is a useful tool to use gently along the backs of their legs.  As for myself, this is a FABULOUS tool to use on my feet!  I highly recommend this to any therapist as a self care tool, or to anyone wanting to benefit from massage work at home.  Sturdy and durable."

I don't think I will ever purchase another plastic slate again, but in a pinch, it will do the job.<br /><br />I would say maybe the difficulty is in the stylus I use, but I've tried a few different ones, and tried them on plastic and metal, and invariably have an easier time with the metal ones. If you prefer plastic, then this will do what you need, but if you don't mind going for the metal ones, I think they are sturdier and easier to use personally."

Again, you control all the ingredients and how sweet or bitter you make the chocolate.<br /><br />And you get a great kick by adding this to smoothies. It just rounds out the flavors and makes a smoothie more interesting.<br /><br />The packaging is outstanding. The bottom of the bag has a football shape, so the bag will stand up right.

I had to lay on it for about 2-3 times a day for 2 days before I noticed my lower back really relaxing. Once you've relaxed, you can feel your back start to stretch and move back into place.<br /><br />I'd recommend trying different heights, either using the foam pad provided or using smaller books. Just make sure you're not resting on the books or you won't receive the benefit. I would highly recommend this to anyone that sits all day for work. I haven't tried sitting on it yet, but I know that it is also recommended for that as well."

Some products make your hair look too greasy or shiny, others make your hair far too unnatural looking.<br /><br />Fiber provides the perfect look and feel in my opinion because you really can't tell there is any product in your hair if applied sparingly. In fact, you do not have to use a lot of this product depending on how much hair you have making it last a long time. Overall, I've been hooked on this product for years now and have used nothing else."

My fiance' is always aching due to working and being on his feet for 8 hrs so when this stick arrived, he looked at it like 'foreign contaminant&#34;. I told him I will show him when he lay down. He lied down on his stomach, flat, and I began to roll the stick up and down his back. It rolled very well and he said it felt soothing, but he is a man and they are built tough lol.

B00V2L5JRA,Xtreme Comforts Coccyx Orthopedic Comfort Memory Foam Seat Cushion,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I like the stability and easy maintenance of a solid wood chair, but they can be hard on the back and hips after a few hours, so I started using this cushion.  It covers the whole chair bottom.  The first time I sat on it, I noticed that my back had less tension and I sat up straighter with less effort.  I am guessing that this is because of the space on the back of the cushion.  It feels like it gives my spine more room in the sitting position to stretch out and relax.  The foam this cusion is made of is not the dense, stiff memory foam that takes a while to expand after you compress it.  This foam moves with you and has a little spring to it.  One thing I would add to this cushion is some grippers on the bottom.  It is not much of an issue on upholstered surfaces, but it slides around on wood and other smooth surfaces.  Discounted sample provided for review."

Also, the key used to unlock it is incredibly difficult to maneuver...I'm 35 years old and have my dexterity in my fingers still and could barely get it to stay in my hand long enough to try the unlock, bc the key is so short, nothing to grab onto. I cannot imagine an elderly person or one with arthritis or other fine motor skill challenges trying to do it. Returning the product only 48 hours after receiving it."

B0037O2J7I,4 Way Shiny Block / 4 Step Buffing Block Shine Nail Buffer,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I purchased this for my 9 yo daughter to use and it has held up very well to that abuse. All four sides are initially labeled with the order you need to use them. But as you use block, the wording will fade away. Not an inconvenience for my daughter who has memorized what order to use each color.<br /><br />The block works just as you would expect it to. Start with the baby blue edge to smooth and shape your nail edge. You can also use this side to smooth out any deep ridges on your nail face. Next use the pink side to smooth not so deep ridges on your nail face. Then the dark blue side will smooth your nail face even more. And last but not least, the green side will shine your nail face.<br /><br />My daughter uses this almost everyday and it has held up very well. And she keeps getting complements on how well her nails look!  Many people assume that she uses a clear cost nail polish when in reality she isn't.<br /><br />The file sides are glued on to a rectangular foam block that has a little five to it. It weighs nothing, and has just enough flex in it to make it comfortable to use. No side has come unglued, nor has anything started peeling off. It is very well constructed. We clean it by gently rubbing a damp wash cloth over each side and letting it dry overnight. But we only clean it when needed and not everyday.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product."

B0000537JQ,Ezy Dose Weekly,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Very happy ~ There are the largest containers I have found.  Been using this type for years, but after so many years, the old ones became stained and don't close tightly anymore.  So bought these as a replacement.  Almost clear, so it's easy to see the tablets inside.  Snaps shut snugly, easy to open and holds a LOT of tablets/pills.  Of course, the number will depend on the sizes.  I take a lot of vitamins which are large - typically calcium, E, B, Flavinoids, and some small like A, D and Selinium etc.  With a mixture, I have 12 in one compartment with room for several more.  Very satisfied.  Will to back to order more so I can pack 2 weeks at a time.  A tip - when stocking these compartments with a mixture of tablets, capsules, gel caps and caplets etc., store them in the fridge whenever possible.  Oils and moisture can make them discolor and stick together in warm weather, esp if in a humid summer climate."

B010S4F5DE,"Weight Loss Belt-Belly Fat Belt and Waist Trimmer, 8in, Black, (Stomach Belt For Weight Loss)",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"This belt is about 40&#34; long and 8&#34; wide. It has on one side a velcro that cover the full 8 inches of length. What I like about the waist trimmer:<br />+ the inner material makes you sweat for sure<br />+ it is wide enough to cover the mid section<br />+ it can go under loose clothing without standing out<br /><br />Cons<br />- the velcro cover the full side, it can be very uncomfortable if it hits the skin. I usually secure it diagonally, that way the velcro won't hit my skin<br />- the sides are not stitched, after a while the upper material will start rolling down. Also because of this, it doesn't have extra support. So when you over stretch it, it will start curling down your belly.<br />- material is not breathable. You can not keep it on over night, as the rubber won't let your skin breath. 1-2 hours are just fine.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars and not less, because when you wear it, especially while working out, it will make you sweat. It does the job, I just like my other one better. The other one is longer, velcro is in the middle extended out from the belt. And the material is breathable.<br />I was asked to review the belt by belly blaster. I received it for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

Product is as pictured, so that was nice.  Very tight entry and interior.  I would be what can only be described as below average in the manhood department, so buyer beware.  Once in, the constraint upon the member was severe.  Struggled to move past the halfway mark.  This might have been due to a little trepidation on my part, not wanting to tear the thing. I'm not saying it's delicate, but I certainly treated it as such.  Not a whole lot beyond just being tight and very smooth.  Decent, but it won't knock your socks off."

B00XZJ2G46,"Vision Spinner II Variable Voltage Battery, 1600mAh",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Update Aug 23:  I've mostly solved the &#34;invisible button&#34; issue by asking my wife to paint the button with red nail polish.  It still allows the light to show through and makes it easier to find the button visually.  --------------------------------------------------  This will be a review of the Spinner II vs the original Spinner vs the eGo USB vs the eGo-C vs the eGo variable voltage wired pass-thru. I've been using eGo systems and accessories since their inception, so I can tell you about all there is to know, I guess.  I'd been using various drip systems when I found the eGo drip version, liked the long-lasting rechargeable 350mw battery that was so much more simple than removable batteries, so I've stuck with a simple system that worked well for many years.  Pretty much the only changes I've made were increasing battery capacity and going to the simple Innokin Clearomizer tank system.  It's a system that is fairly durable, makes enough vapor to satisfy me but not make a cloud that is so obvious that I'm easily detected in questionable zones.  But you only want to know about the batteries, particularly the Spinner II... and you guys that use baseball bat sized battery systems that you still have to drip into so you can make an explosion of vapor are not going to be interested in an eGo anyway... so here goes:  The new Vision Spinner II differs from the original first of all that it is more powerful (1600mw vs 1200) and about a 5/8 of an inch longer, but since the switches are located at about the same place, I doubt there is &#34;actual&#34; battery located in the extra length.  It's a tiny bit heavier and about the same diameter... see attached pic.  At the 3.8 volt setting, both of my vision batteries make the same amount of vapor as does the USB battery.  I use 3.8 volts because the higher settings tend to make me go through atomizers and liquid faster as well as charring the liquid and making it taste bad after a tank or two.  Other points for the new Spinner version are a detented control that has a slotted bottom that I guess is intended for a coin in case you don't have a strong grip.  The old version turned more easily and just had a narrow grip that turned way too easily and often got reset accidentally.  Also the place at the top where you used to be able to screw on a &#34;beauty ring&#34; is gone, which allows the overall length to be less... you can see from the pic that the black battery portion is about an inch longer in the new unit, but overall length is only a half inch or so longer.  My single complaint would be the button, which is only to be found by looking for it... you can't find it by touch like on the old one, but that's fine with me.  Other guys have complained here about the top breaking loose when they carry the unit in their jeans pocket, and that's a design flaw in the original and all other eGo batteries.  Don't put them in your jeans pocket.  I usually just keep mine in my hand since I constantly puff, but if you go into a restricted zone you'll need to find a hiding place.  Pants with long, low pockets are good.  I still have and use ALL of the battery systems listed on the top line of this review and tend to use the pass-thru more than any other, simply because I am a computer addict as well as e-vapor addict... so that's where I usually hang out.  I prefer this new Spinner II simply because it has a powerful, long lasting battery and allows me to be mobile for longer times.  Of course I have a 4amp charger in the car, so I don't often get caught with dead batteries anyway, but of all of the systems listed here, the USB's seem to last the shortest time before expiring forever.  I've broken many in jeans, and I've worn many out, but I'm not ready to go to a baseball bat sized battery either.  I like this one and hope you will to.  I'll update if I have any problems to tell about."

B0037O2J7I,4 Way Shiny Block / 4 Step Buffing Block Shine Nail Buffer,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"[[VIDEOID:e2fe389292a981626ff558dabbc3cf43]]The 4 step buffing block is what I consider a four star product. It could be a 3 or 5 star depending on your use.    To start, the length of the block is about 3.5 inches (~9cm). Sides 1&3 are about 1 inch in height while sides 2&4 are are 1 1/4 inches in height. I couldn't figure out why there's a size difference except maybe a manufacturing reason. It really shouldn't make much of a difference.    It made with a foam block with each of the sides glued to it. For occasional home use, this should hold up just fine (watch out cats like these!). With heavy use, I'm a little hesitant if it would hold up.    One thing to consider is that this isn't a 6 step buffer. A six step buffer would give you a more gradual transition between each of the steps, perhaps giving you a little bit better of a job.    If your nails are in bad shape, you might want to go to a nail salon and get them to a place that you could use this for maintenance. This tool isn't quite robust enough to tackle tough jobs, but it would be great for maintaining nails.    Overall, you should be reasonably pleased with this. Sure, it might not be professional grade, but for the price it'll be hard to find something other than this for the same quality level."

B00J7G934C,"Oral-B Super Floss, Dental Floss, Original (50-count)",Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"Terrible for braces - the floss begins to shread after flossing only two teeth, leaving behind long very thin wisps of the frayed spongy material which are almost impossible to unwind from around the braces.  You have to use tweezers, and even then you keep finding more days later.  I can't understand all the rave reviews -- unless you're willing to use a different strand after every two teeth.  Even when you're very careful to be gentle removing the strand, it catches on the metal and frays.  This happens whether the section of the braces has a little hook on it or not.  Very disappointed."

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I have been using this cream for about three weeks now, and I'd say it's one of the better out of the many, many creams I've tried for eczema in my lifetime. It's not greasy at all, absorbs quickly, has no fragrance, and is full of nourishing ingredients. I'm coming off of topical steroids after a year, so it hasn't really been helpful with the bad flare-ups, but once I get one under control, it does help calm the skin and keep it moisturized. I tried it on my 19-month-old's eczema as well, and it didn't really do much, but then I rubbed it into his cradle cap, and it got rid of it in a single application! I couldn't believe it. Overall, I think this is a great moisturizing cream with excellent ingredients, but it's not a miracle cure."

We had the same problem as another reviewers with fabric waterproof mattress covers: they shred if you have to wash them frequently, liquids often seep through, you have to own several since they take forever to air dry (they fall apart faster if you dry them in a dryer). The vinyl these are made of is sturdy. Cleanup is greatly simplified, I strip the soiled sheet off and wipe the cover clean, and put on a new sheet. Done. I also got the &#34;Crisscross Adjustable Bed Sheet Straps Suspenders,&#34; so it stays on and doesn't bunch."

B00008LUPP,Ezy Dose Locking Pill Planner,Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"UPDATE:  Box broke after 3 weeks. The plastic for the covers is far too fragile to last long. After only three weeks one of the doors snapped off in my hand. I hadn't even made it twice through the two weeks of pills that this box holds. I will be returning it immediately and looking for a replacement. My last box from Walmart lasted me 7 years. I didn't get a month from this one.<br /><br />INITIAL REVIEW: Great pill box.  Because each week is colored differently I can tell one week from another.  My last one was blue all over so I had to mark one Sunday as a starting point.  My only tiny complaint is that both weeks are lined up exactly day for day; meaning Sunday is over Sunday, etc.  This is different from my last box which had the weeks lines up back to back.  With he old one I would go down one row and up the other.  Now I have to be conscious to start from the left each time.  No big deal LOL.<br /><br />The covers snap in solidly and release once you push the side release button.  The covers snap on and off fairly hard which is great for not losing pills but could be a challenge for seniors who have weakness in their hands. But I'm also sure the effort needed will decrease as the box gets used and broken in.  All in all a good product that works well.  I would recommend it if it fits your need."

In less than a week of wearing this belt, I feel normal again.  It is narrow enough to fit under the baby bump, not really noticeable under my clothes and my midwife told me that it won't hurt baby's development.  She even asked where I purchased it and the brand so that she could recommend it to other patients.  The belt is comfortable to wear and not too hot in the 95F summer heat.  Highly recommend!"

The first one was a different brand and organic buckwheat.  The pillow I purchased before was pretty small.  This one surprised me with how big it was (yes, even after reading the dimensions).  Some of the reviews say it isn't filled enough, but I don't have that problem.  The filler buckwheat is not expensive, and the fill level is very personal.  These pillows are loud at first and it takes an adjustment.  I've used these for almost 3  years now and I notice a HUGE difference if I have to sleep with a different pillow.  The only reason I needed a new one is because I left my old one in a hotel room.  I bought this one because it was cheaper than the one I had previously purchased and bigger."

B00UCT5L6W,Newest Eleaf Istick 50W FULL KIT (red),Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I LOVE my istick, I am brand new to vaping and am on day 5 of absolutely not 1 cigarette. After 22 years of smoking and multiple times of trying to quit I can't tell you how thrilled I am. I did order everything I needed online and saved a ton of money rather than buy it at the vape shop, between taxes and cost my savings was well over $50. I paired my Eleaf with the Aero Tank 2. When everything arrived I went to the vape shop and got my lesson and bought 3 vape flavors with 12mg nicotine....I was a pack a day smoker so that's what the shop recommended. There are so many vaping flavors out there that it is overwhelming but I eventually settled on Wild Blueberry, Vanillafied, and Strawberry Banana Ice Cream( my personal favorite). Three vape bottles cost me with tax around $27, and the rate I'm going through the juice VS. the cost of a pack of cigarettes, I can tell I'm probably going to easily save $60 a month. I have my stick set at 9.6 watts which seems to be perfect for me. Once you get your watts set, make sure you lock it by holding down both arrows at the same time. I forgot to lock mine and cranked up the watts while driving and didn't notice and yikes! I can already feel a difference in my lungs. I feel this is one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life and wish I would have done this years ago. Now I smell like a walking Yankee candle instead of a nasty stale bar. Hoping to go down to 6 mg of nicotine in a couple of months and then zero...then hopefully quit altogether. One step at a time though...and the red is actually hot pink(which being a girl didn't bother me, but guys unless you want a girly istick stay away from the red)"

I started out with a small eczema patch, but when I started to use it, things got worse. I thought that it may be my skin getting used to the product, but after 2wks it just got bigger. I wouldn't recommend this product, but did try another product after, which works wonders for me. What I used at first was the Neosporin eczema essential (daily moisturizing cream), but this also didn't work for me and irritated my skin. What worked for me was the Neosporin eczema essential (Anti-itch cream), it didn't make my skin red like the other neosporin product and results can be seen within a day. I mixed it with regular neosporin (pain relief cream/first aid antibiotic) at first since it was red and weeping. But within a day it healed and some on the scab came off."

B00H8ZTLLY,doTERRA On Guard Essential Oil Protective Blend Beadlets 125 ct,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I really think the beads taste perfectly wonderful. They remind me of the smell of the florist section at Michael's. I think the obsessions about pumpkin lattes might make these more popular because I can see people adding these or the plain oil to make a better tasting pumpkin latte. I was surprised it was such a familiar taste that just reminds you of autumn because with the eucalyptus and cloves in it I thought it would taste like menthol but it really has a dominating cinnamon and orange flavor with the other oils just making it still smell more like an autumn brew of some kind.  I was a little worried these would make me be unfocused because my liver is so sensitive due to a candida infection I can't really drink alcohol and occasionally feel woozy from burnt oil or always from dark meat. I did not have any problem feeling woozy at all, and I was really surprised because I literally can get drunk from Rum Raisin ice cream or the wrong kind of vinegar. I also think this product is less toxic than soy sauce because I also can't use soy sauce without feeling tipsy. If I drink a Kambucha I basically also get drunk enough to feel like it was two or three beers for a healthy person. No problems with this though! I am very surprised, and I am going to keep using these. I want to add to the general conversations that I did have my infection through college but actually never caught a cough, cold, or sore throat for the first two years because I always washed my hands or used alcohol-spray hand sanitizer (bought) before touching my face or eating anything and it really was worth going to the trouble of always having the spray in my purse. It is so worth not being sick, especially because I was living in an apartment with three other girls who definitely would have gotten me sick! I also was not a clean freak during that time and really only kept my hands clean even though I constantly was typing in library settings late at night or working in public. Before I started college I caught a cold from getting ready to go and maybe that motivated me to stay healthy, but just that worked. After college I got lazy about cleaning my hands and did catch a nasty cold again which I think motivated me to keep my hands clean and I have not gotten a cold since! I also did not ever get a flu shot which I don't really think work. Nonetheless, I highly recommend these beadles to anyone with chronic problems!"

B00V2L5JRA,Xtreme Comforts Coccyx Orthopedic Comfort Memory Foam Seat Cushion,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I’ve had issues with back pain since my first pregnancy, I should seriously probably look into going to a chiropractor or something but that’s a story for another day! My back pain seems to get really bad when I’m standing for too long of a stretch of time or sitting for too long of a stretch of time. When I sit down to blog or go on our insanely long road trips my back shouts OOOOUUUCH at me. If your wondering what a road trip is to us, it can be anything from 1 hour to 27+ hours…my back isn’t having it.<br /><br />This is a pretty decent sized cushion. Not ridiculously big but a nice large size perfect for office chairs, or a driver’s or passenger’s seat in a car, I think you could even take it with you to any event you might be sitting at for long periods of time! I like that the cover has a zipper along one side so you can remove it and just toss it to wash if it gets dirty. I also have started putting it on the floor while I sit down with my 2 year old and almost 7 month old to play. Them being so young I sit on the floor a lot to be at their level and engage as much as possible with them. This is helping more than I thought it could during play time!<br /><br />It’s a full cushion made of memory foam which springs back up as soon as you get off it. I like that it’s not super squishy but a good mix of the soft squishy feeling of memory foam and a bit of firmness that helps you keep good posture while sitting. I’m sure this can only help with back pain as well! Once I sat it seemed to keep me sitting properly, I sat straight up, and I noticed I didn’t have that mid and lower back pain I’ve been dealing with for a long time. It might sound silly but I might be traveling everywhere I go with my seat cushion!<br /><br />You might not have thought about why your back is hurting but if you fix one of the main issues, how and where you chose to sit you might end up feeling a world of difference. Simply placing this cushion down before I sit has helped me immensely and I’m totally thankful to Xtreme Comforts because I’ve forgotten what it feels like to sit down for any length of time without having to fidget and move around to make my back stop aching!<br /><br />**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**helped me immensely and I’m totally thankful to Xtreme Comforts because I’ve forgotten what it feels like to sit down for any length of time without having to fidget and move around to make my back stop aching!<br /><br />**I received a free product for a review.

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have had the Prurigo Nodularis extreme eczema for almost two years.  The itch is extremely intense and after 3 rounds of Prednisol and no relief in sight I did a lot of research and tried  homeopathic creams and herbal preparations before  I came across The Era Organics Eczema & Psoriasis Cream.  To my knowledge there are no other drugs available from Western Medicine only moisturizers which did not help in my case. I had consulted Five Dermatologists and was told this was my new life style.  I had a lot of open sores and lumps and bumps that itched incredibly.  When I purchased the first jar of Era Organics and I put the cream on immediately when it starts to itch, the itch will go away almost immediately. It is of most importance in my case with the Prurigo N. that the cream is applied immediately,that means about 4 to 5 times a day and before bed time.  I have been doing this for the last 2 months approximately and  my skin is improving after 18 months of horrible lumps and bumps. The itch is still there but minimal and immediately gone if I apply the Era Organics.  The most important thing is to apply immediately so you do not scratch and create more bumps.  I am pleased to have this cream and will be recommending it. I need to add to my original review.  4 months have passed after I used the Era Organics 4 x a day to eliminate the itching.  I needed to use it less and less and am happy to report that I have no more issues with the Prurigo Nodularis, except some scars left on my legs.  I have no further itching, or eczema and my legs are clear of any lumps and open sores.  This Era Organics Eczema & Psoriasis Cream was a major contributing factor in eliminating this extreme eczema. The other factors were herbal treatments and acupuncture.  I am convinced that without the Era Organics I would not have been able to stop the itching and the continued creating of new nodules and sores.  I strongly recommend this product for Prurigo Nodularis."

I am 45, and have experienced reduced libido and unreliable erections (sometimes soft, sometimes hard but then gets soft in the middle of the action or when changing positions, and sometimes everything working as it should). According to description and reviews, this &#34;magic stuff&#34; was supposed to fix both lack of libido and fickle erections. A natural skeptic I figured, why not give it a try, especially since it has received such high reviews, but now I have been using it for a month, and I experience no difference at all! Just another scam. Strange how dishonest people are allowed to lie flat out, just if they disclaim that none of their claims have been scientifically tested or proven (which in real terms means &#34;a scam&#34;).<br />I have on few occasions used the approved stuff (Viagra), and that really works, so I guess I'll be relying on that in the future."

The actual product is quite close to looking like the sales picture here and the craftsmanship is quite good for the money. However, upon arrival, there were a few hair strands astray and during the first use some hair did fall off (no big deal). More importantly, upon use I find this to be quite good at creating lather with little shaving cream and the application feels comfortable and soft. All in all, a solid four star item for a relatively low price. Made in China, according to label on box."

B00T56492U,"Caffeine Energy Gum 50mg Caffeine Taurine & B-Vitamins Per Piece coffee / Energy drink, Quick Energy Boost By RUN GUM",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I love running, I love caffeine, and I love something in my mouth while I run - oh, and I'm a closet gum chewer. Due to my allergy meds, I suffer from constant dry mouth - not just when running, all day long. (And before you ask - no, I don't have diabetes, thank you, I've been tested.) I may also be guilty of hanging my mouth open too long or breathing through my mouth, I really don't know, but what I do know is that I have dry mouth.<br /><br />For me, during longer runs, dry mouth then turns into a case of chapped lips. By the time I've finished a half marathon, I look like Bobo the Clown!! To avoid that lovely post-race photo look, I usually use sugar-free cough drops which last in my mouth approximately 2.5 miles. I used to use Jolly Ranchers, but they became way too sweet after a short time.<br /><br />My friends have very politely informed me time and time again that I don't have the skill of chewing gum like a lady and that I should really not chew gum in public. Only those in my close circle see me chew gum at all, since I usually chew it at my desk/cubicle at work, or in the car when I'm driving.  Sometimes I chew it while I'm practicing the drums and I've even boldly chewed it during band practice - trust me when I tell you that people have joked about that too!<br /><br />Okay so this Run Gum™ is ah-mazing people and I'm being totally serious too. I've tried both flavors now and I can't even tell you which one I like better - they both taste great despite being sugar free. There's no icky taste to cover up caffeine like other performance gums, Run Gum just tastes like some good gum!<br /><br />Run Gum™ comes in individual packets with two pieces of gum inside. The instructions clearly advise users to chew one piece of Run Gum™ for mild effect and to chew two pieces for the full kick before they run. They go on to advise users to hew two pieces for &#34;full kick&#34;. Rum Gum™ advises that for best performance, chew a piece before any physical activity and chew another one upon completion. We recommend experimenting and finding what best works for you and your needs. We are all different and have different sensitivities to caffeine, so what works for one, may not work for all.<br /><br />Of course I failed to read these very clear instructions and proceeded to rip the packet open, pop both pieces in my mouth and jumped on the treadmill with the gum in my mouth. I even &#34;parked&#34; it for a time when I was concentrating on my running and when I swished it back, it was still great. It holds its flavor for a little bit longer than a cough drop too - I got three miles out of it before I knew I needed to get rid of it or my jaw would hurt LOL! This paragraph is being added to inform you to follow the Run Gum™ instructions and to not do what I did!<br /><br />Unlike many sources of caffeine that are high in sugar, Run Gum™ uses a combination of artificial sweeteners to provide a great tasting caffeine delivery method without unwanted sucrose.  The gum is available in two flavors, mint and fruit, Run Gum™ provides you with the performance enhancing chemicals your body needs in two delicious, candy coated pieces of chewing gum.<br /><br />Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant, and has been used both recreationally and medicinally to reduce physical fatigue and restore alertness when drowsiness occurs. Run Gum™ contains 50 mg. of caffeine. Taurine is an organic acid that is essential for cardiovascular function and the development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system. (Run Gum™ has 20 mg. of taurine.) Run Gum™ also contains a group of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. Best of all? NO CALORIES and sugar-free!!! yay!!!<br /><br />I received this product without cost in exchange for my honest review and unbiased opinion.tivity and chew another one upon completion.

The so-called &#34;Dutch&#34; method apparently destroys many of the helpful chemicals so eat  that chocolate for pleasure.<br /><br />Lower temperatures will preserve most of the health benefits, and the superb customer service representative at Viva (a nice lady named Vivian) gave me this information:<br /><br />&#34; I believe you are asking whether our cacao nibs and powder are raw, and in regards to this, It is very rare that cacao powder is raw. Unless it is developed using only a fermentation method, only then can it be marketed as a raw product. Oftentimes brands will claim their cacao is raw to appeal to various consumers as a marketing technique, however increasing temperatures is required in order to develop characteristic chocolate flavor. Temperatures are closely monitored with our cacao powder in order to preserve key nutrients and valuable compounds, and third-party analyses are conducted with every batch.<br /><br />&#34;Our cacao nibs are produced using a natural fermentation method. Temperatures do not exceed 114°F, thereby abiding by raw temperature limitations. The fermentation method yields a slightly tart flavor but still lends bold chocolate characteristics in recipes.&#34;<br /><br />Love the company and the customer service, love the sample provided to me for this review, and love the cacao.

It has the natural taste of coco without synthetic sugar or preservatives.  I've sprinkled it on lactose free vanilla ice cream and it gave it a rich chocolate & vanilla flavor.  I've sprinkled it to my black coffee and it gives it a wonderful mocha flavor.  I also find I have more energy when I use the coco powder. I have also purchased coco oil from viva labs as well and I love it! The uses for the coco oil are endless! I have added it to my mocha coffee and the flavor is delicious and a bit exotic. ;-) I have used it on my hair and skin and love the results.<br />My maltese mix shitzu dog has severe skin allergies and suffers tremendously in the summer.  In desperation, I started to rub it all over her coat daily and her allergies have been gone for two weeks now.  Her fur now has a luscious shine to it and she loves to lick the excess coco oil on her fur.  I highly recommend this product, it surpassed my expectations! :)"

B00H9L7VIW,"boostULTIMATE - 60 Capsules - Increase Workout Stamina, Muscle Size, Energy & More 1 Month Supply",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I'm taking this for an increase in sexual responsiveness/libido increase. Seems to do the job along with increasing sensitivity. Also, I am a runner, and I've noticed an increase in stamina regarding exercise. I also like that the ingredients basically seem to be natural as far as I can tell. I did receive a free bottle for a review; however, the review was not required to be positive."
B006Z921ES,Power One Size 312 MERCURY FREE Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries),Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I read the reviews about these Power One Size 312 Mercury Free batteries.  Many reviewers pointed out that they do not last very long.  I decided that the environment was more important than battery life, so I bought these from Amazon.  It turns out they are fantastic lasting as long if not longer than my batteries from the same manufacturer that contained mercury.  I get from 10 - 12 days use from each mercury free battery, and one of them lasted 13 days.  I wear my hearing aids about 11 hours a day, so it's not as if I only wear them a small amount.  It occurs to me to add that I also use a remote with my hearing aids rather than having the volume control on the hearing aids themselves.  I am wondering if this fact somehow leads to longer battery life.  I have no idea about this and my audiologist didn't know either.  I mention it in case it might be a factor.  My suggestion is that if you want to use mercury free batteries is to simply give these a try.  They are not expensive and might work out just fine."

B00OQMNLA4,Loud & Clear Personal Sound Amplifier,Personal_Care_Appliances,1,The battery cover will not stay on making the device useless because the batteries fall out when the cover isn't holding the batteries in place.

I reported this to Amazon and the next day I received a refund and a notice from Amazon I don't need to return the item and I received a refund of my purchase including the shipping.  I call this excellent service by Amazon as I didn't expect to see the refund so soon.  I suggest reporting a broken or defective item to Amazon as soon as it's discovered the item is broken or defective and do so at the Amazon web site so action will be taken sooner than were one to write Amazon and complain.

B00P6TUO5G,"Viva Naturals Organic Non-GMO Cacao Powder, 2 Pound Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,I use Viva Labs Cacao Powder for the antioxidants but the true reason is because I have a sensitive stomach and by mistake I learned cacao actually remedies my problem.

B0002DMANU,Duoderm Extra Thin Cgf Dressing,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"These doctor-ordered bandages were nearly impossible to find at any local pharmacies. When I did find some, the cost was outrageous. Finding them online saved the day. I used them to help heal a small but very stubborn skin infection at a biopsy site on my thigh.

B00GWIGF2Q,Tonus,Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"I almost gave 4- 5 star based on initial use, but after &#60;1 week, the velcro became useless. The overall design is very supportive and materials are sturdy, so now I literally tape it on with strong tape in the morning.  I think any band needs some kind of loop w/ velcro or button system. Also I've found all bands are irritating to skin after awhile, so my solution is to always put over camisole fitted tank top."

I have mild psoriasis on my feet/knees and I diligently put the cream on it twice daily. I emailed the sellers and they recommended I apply it 3 (or more?) times daily, but that wasn't really realistic for me to apply that often (unless maybe I bought one to leave at work, too?). The cream worked well enough to soften the extremely dry spots as well or better than prescription steroid creams I've used. Over time with use it has continued to improve the spots....but so far in more than a month, they haven't disappeared. The cream does not have added fragrances, which is a good thing, but the cream also does have a slightly rancid smell when I first apply it. It's not very strong and seems to disappear quickly, though.<br />I did contact the company and found them to be very helpful and responsive. I plan to continue using this cream and hoping it continues to improve my skin!"

B00SWIXDPG,Armor1 Ankle Roll Guard (Right Foot) the Alternative to Ankle Braces,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Updated review of the Ankle Roll Guard on 8/26/2015. After using the ASO Stabilizer for a couple of weeks playing competitive pickleball, I decided to once again try the Ankle Roll Guard. The reasons for the switch back to the Roll Guard from the stabilizer are that the stabilizer was very uncomfortable and it restricted my mobility. I have thus been using the Roll Guard for roughly 30 days without incident. The Roll Guard is many times more comfortable than the stabilizer (you don’t know you have it on) & the Guard does not restrict mobility. The key to having success with the Roll Guard is proper fitting. Once done, the Guard works perfectly! I will continue to use it in my play & now recommend it to others. If you experience ankle rolls try the Ankle Roll Guard. It comes with a 30-day money back guarantee from the owner who does more than his due diligence to make sure you have a positive experience with the product!  Used the Roll Guard for 30+ days while playing pickleball. Recently while using the Roll Guard, I rolled my ankle. Have switched to the ASO Ankle Stabilizer."

B00V2L5JRA,Xtreme Comforts Coccyx Orthopedic Comfort Memory Foam Seat Cushion,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I sit at a desk for 8+ hours each day. The office chair I am provided isn't exactly comfortable, and after long days, I often experience pain in my hips, thighs, and lower back. I take time to move away from my chair when I can, but also hoped a seat cushion would assist in making my work day more comfortable.<br /><br />This seat cushion has a durable cover and is made from memory foam. The foam molds and conforms to my body, yet maintains a fairly firm shape. This helps to ensure that my back remains aligned. Since using this cushion, my pain from sitting each day has dramatically decreased. I no longer leave work with pain radiating down my leg and feel more comfortable when sitting. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own."

We ordered two of them from Amazon, to have ready for us when we returned home. My husband and I have somewhat broad shoulders and are side sleepers. Our shoulders are sometimes hurting in the morning, but not with this pillow. We use it as a &#34;foundation&#34; and put our feather pillows on top. This minimizes the noise of the hulls moving around since the pillow is not right next to ears, and also gives our shoulders a break since our heads are up higher. We definitely enjoy these pillows."

I put it on first, then I wear spanx that goes up to my chest, then sometimes I wear another spanx as a camisole top.  You have to wear a loose fitting top though.  The belt sort of makes your stomach look extra fat, that's why I wear the spanx over it.  But I wear it every day, and especially when I go to the airport and ride on the plane.  I can remember the days when I could not get up out of an airplane seat (I still check my luggage because I cannot pick up my luggage into the overhead bin).  And I must wear it while doing laundry, or grocery shopping.  You just have to wear a loose top."

The bifocal is low enough in the lens that it doesn't get in the way.  The glasses came in a nice zippered, semi-hard case that should protect them from scratches.

Then, the plastic suddenly... almost overnight... WARPED... EVERY one of them.  I tried fixing them by rubberbanding them and putting them in very hot water.  Was hoping that the memory in the plastic would recover.  NO LUCK. I'm still using them but the clasps no longer catch and I have to use 6 or more rubberbands to maintain the hope of air-tight.  I loved them at first and am so disappointed.  They are NOT cheap.  If anyone has any recommendations about where to find a similar, more durable product, I'd love to know about it"

I've only been using it at work for a couple days, but i think I'm going to order the standard one and see if I like it better. Nothing wrong with the product, I just think it is too firm for me and thought I would put it out there on a review for others like me."

B00WAMU72W,Royal Massage Clamshell Hot Stone Heater with 4 Hot Rocks,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I purchased this out of curiousity.  Certainly for the price, I wasn't expecting spa grade material but what I received exceeded my expectations.  The stones weren't quite as large as I thought they might be but they are large enough and seem to be of good quality.  (I've added a photo for reference) No pits or rough edges.  The warmer does indeed heat them as quickly as claimed and to a suitable temperature: not too hot to handle yet hot enough to relax tense muscles.  I don't know that I'd recommend this for professional use (the instruction leaflet that accompanies the product does state it is for home use) as it's rather small.  Although if you're just starting out, it might be worth the investment.  The stones do heat quickly so after you've worked through the remaining three (assuming you use product as sold with 4 stones) the first stone will be hot again.  Given the size of the warmer (think smallish handbag) it would travel well.  I've only given it 4 stars because I've only just recieved it a few hours ago and I'm not sure how the heating mechanisms will last over time.  For the price if it makes it a year, I'll be very impressed and update my review.  Overall for those interested in the benefits of hot stone massage it's an excellent product and you can't beat the price."

It took awhile to prime. The best part is the Rba section, its easy to build on,  flavor comes out much better than the pre made coils. The top filing port is an added bonus,  as it's much easier to refill the tank. It's an awesome sub ohm tank, looks great and would definitely recommended to others."
B00H9L7VIW,"boostULTIMATE - 60 Capsules - Increase Workout Stamina, Muscle Size, Energy & More 1 Month Supply",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I originally purchased this because a family member of mine has IBS  (and its symptoms are VERY persistent and annoying) and I wanted to heal damage done by poor lifestyle choices.  I decided to get this particular probiotic b/c I read that it targets the small and large intestine specifically. I suspect my family member has leaky gut (which has caused me to develop some food allergies - but that's just MY theory.) Anyhow, it works well and seems to have reduced her issues. It has helped to settle her intestines down a bit I think. It (for sure) has helped w/the bloating associated with IBS. Her IBS issues seem to be more localized now to the gut as opposed to full-body (which they were prior.) Hope this is helpful to others."

B003Z6D008,Genuine Ogallala Bay Rum Regular Cologne and Aftershave. 8 oz Bottles,Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"The ingredients are way too primitive to really call this an aftershave or (as the bottle says) cologne. There aren't enough ingredients to build chords, and it's super volatile. By the time you leave your front door, the smell is mostly gone. By the time you get where you're going, no one will notice how nice you smell. Amazon calls this an aftershave, which is a stretch but somewhat palpable. The manufacturer calls this a cologne, which just doesn't work at all. I'll continue to use this as an aftershave, nothing more, until the bottle is done. Then I'll keep looking."

Was much better than I expected.  When I use it with shave cream and a little water it works as good as my razor.  I also use it dry when I need to do a quick shave.  You need to be patient and go slowly across your face to get all your beard.  I am glad I bought it.  It was a great price through Amazon.

The only problem is its &#34;Wrist band length&#34; is around 8 inches (more or less). My wrist is little bigger than average, so I had to spend like $45 extra to extend the band with extra chain links from a Tissot authorized dealer. Other than that, the outlook is stunning (For WHITE Dial), the design & craftsmanship is 100% precise, The material quality is superb  & my wife actually liked it so much that she almost wanted it....Almost :)"

B00P6TUO5G,"Viva Naturals Organic Non-GMO Cacao Powder, 2 Pound Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I've been learning to make chocolate, (especially sugar free using monk fruit sweetener!)  The batches I made tasted ok, but I had not as yet discovered the Swerve brand confectioners style so it was gritty.  I've used the cocoa from Trader Joe's which tastes great from the spoon, so I figured it would make great chocolate, but it was kinda bland, but I chalked it up to inexperience...same with another organic cocoa from Amazon that I can't remember...Sorry!<br /><br />ANYWAY, I had to reorder more cocoa and I remembered someone reviewing another brand saying that they preferred the cocoa from Viva labs and I figured it was worth a shot, thinking, &#34;cocoa powder is cocoa powder&#34; and not expecting much.  But it fit my criteria organic and processed at low temperatures, so I ordered this.<br /><br />My next batch of chocolate I made with my adult son who was visiting and is fond of dark chocolate, like 90% cocoa!  So we opened this bag and added it to the melted cocoa butter and I got out the powdered sugar and he had me shake it in as he stirred.  He stopped me with only enough sugar to look like a garnish!  But it was HIS batch so I figured, &#34;okayyy&#34;!  :-D<br /><br />It hardened in good &#34;temper&#34; and we all broke off little pieces to try.  I knew that this would taste mostly of just the cocoa we'd used since the cocoa butter was a mix of the lovely fragrant organic cocoa butter from the Dominican Republic sold on Amazon, and this very bland fragrance-less stuff from Ghana, and a bit of cocoa butter from Bulk Apothecary which smells ok, but not as amazing as the Dominican but it's half their price.  So the cocoa BUTTER used in this batch wouldn't have explained the pronounced difference in the flavor when we finally ate his chocolate.<br /><br />AMAZING!  Except for mild textual differences the chocolate made with the Viva labs cocoa powder tasted very much like a 90% cocoa bar I'd bought my son from Lindt chocolates! ( And Lindt is the chocolate we prefer above all others, using IT as the standard by which we judge any of my chocolates...I make truffles too.)<br /><br />  I couldn't get over how much better it tasted compared to the batches made from other cocoa powders!  I've learned that in things like brownies, even tho I make them dark and rich with lots off cocoa, the cocoa is still pretty much interchangeable because the other ingredients added so much of their own flavor.<br /><br />But in CHOCOLATE it's just cocoa butter, cocoa powder,sweetener to taste and a touch of salt if you want and at the most, if desired,, milk solids. (Buy full fat POWDER tho if you're making milk chocolate, and expect a tiny bit of grit from that, worth it tho if you like milk chocolate! :-D)  That's IT, and the cocoa butter and sweeteners add nothing really to the flavor, the sweetener enhances is all, but doesn't ADD flavor.  So we were basically eating solidified cocoa with a dash of sugar and it was AWESOME!<br /><br />Now I wish I could find the cocoa butter made from these same cocoa beans from Viva, but couldn't find any listed. :-\  But I don't think it would matter much in the flavor anyway, it's the cocoa POWDER that's got all this amazing flavor!<br /><br />What a nice discovery!  Thanks Viva! :-D"

B007OUYX66,Remington Smooth and Silky Full Size Epilator (EP6010),Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"It's like a little box of magical robotic tweezers that yank out unwanted body hair fast. Epiliated areas take a few weeks to grow back for me, compared to a few days if I just shave. My previous experiements with waxing have all left me sore, sticky, and still hairy, so I can't compare the epiliator to a successful wax.<br /><br />Sure, it hurts a bit (you're yanking out a bunch of hair all at once; what else do you expect?), but on areas where you can contort yourself to keep the skin taut, it's really not so bad. Additionally, the vibration from the little motor inside seems to have some kind of soothing/numbing effect (or maybe that's just endorphins).<br /><br />It's easy to clean with the included brush thingy, which is small and easy to lose and can be replaced with a dollar-store toothbrush. I'd recommend making sure any area you use it on is clean and dry -- I've owned the damn thing for a year now and still haven't figured out how to get the spinny head bit out for any cleaning that'd require immersing it in a liquid. Oh yeah, and listen to the manual when it says which of the 2 speeds to use on which areas -- the faster speed actually tends to hurt less, so use it where you can."

I am that amazon customer who returns products when they don't work as stated on labels. I DO NOT have to return this product. I will be buying it for my nurse friends on their birthdays.

No need to gift wrap this. The deodorant crystal is nice and smooth to the touch. Per the packaging this deodorant is activated by water, so if you walk out of the shower, one can just place this on. The reason I am giving this product 3 stars is due to the contents, the entire deodorant stick is made out of potassium alum, and a quick google search says alum is short for aluminum. Aluminum is absorbed through the skin and builds up in the body. Due to the company not advertising the Potassium Alum as an ingredient, I am giving this product 3 stars.<br />Disclaimer: I received a substantial discount on this product to provide an honest review."

Fantastic airflow for producing large amounts of vapor and due to the way the airflow works also great flavor. Tank over all holds 5ml of juice so can pretty much last me the whole day. The ability to change to colors on the O rings is a nice touch and I am currently rocking it with the blue. Would definitely recommend this tank to anyone looking to get one, or even to someone that just wants to try something new."

B000SOQ30E,"MedMobile® BATHTUB TRANSFER BENCH / BATH CHAIR WITH BACK, WIDE SEAT, ADJUSTABLE SEAT HEIGHT, SURE-GRIPED LEGS, LIGHTWEIGHT, DURABLE, RUST-RESISTANT SHOWER BENCH",Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"My main problem with the bench has to do with the bolts and nuts.  First, when the transfer bench arrived, the small bag that is supposed to contain this hardware was broken so that the bolts, washers, and nuts were strewn around the larger plastic wrapping that surrounds the structural pieces of the bench kit.  Had I not, luckily, discovered this problem, I would have opened the plastic wrapping and spent the next hour (probably hopelessly) trying to find the hardware.  So, be careful when you open the package.  Secondly, one of the nuts was made improperly -- the nut's O-ring was broken to the point of making the O-ring, and thus the nut, impenetrable and therefore useless.  Unfortunately, no additional nuts were included with the hardware (some extra bolts and washers were).  The instructions should also have indicated whether the end of the nut with the O-ring goes to the outside (away from the bolt's head) or inside (toward the bolt's head).  I did the former.  The color-coding of the bolts was useful, however.  The chair is light, which makes it easy to take in and out of the tub, but seems a little flimsy.  The bench is otherwise good would have gotten a much higher rating from me without these problems."
B00012FJ9O,Lobob Soft Contact Insertion/Removal Kit,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I have tried 3 different removal tools, plus the old-fashioned finger-slide method that always worked for me in the past, and this, along with copious flooding of Systane Ultra eye drops and Overnight Therapy Gel is the only one of the three that works for me.  I actually think the key to this process is to order several different options and try patiently each one to see which works best for you.  Getting them in with this Lobb inserter is usually very easy--getting one of them out is often a real challenge so that I leave it in overnight and can always remove it easily the next morning, sometimes using the inserter to slide it off to the side where it forms a bubble and I can grab it with the tweezer held right at the correct angle.  You need to relax and use plenty of drops.  Good luck!"

I personally have a permanent retainer, and I've tried other forms of floss created to get underneath the metal linings, but everything is typically too long and of cheap, floss-like texture.

Instead, I use regular floss for my other teeth and use the shortened super floss for my retainer teeth."

B00NAC44KM,"ErgoAlign Ergonomic Memory Foam Orthopedic Coccyx Relief Seat Cushion (100% Money Back Guarantee) Best for Wheelchair, Office Chair Pad, Travel Seat Pillow or Home Sciatica (Gray/Grey)",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,This Memory Foam Seat Cushion is AMAZING! It came in a handy carrying pouch. The pouch zips up completely and has handles for easy storage/portability. The cover on the seat cushion is a very soft material. Its similar to velour/plush. The cover is removable and I imagine it can also be washed. The memory foam seems to be very thick and durable. I've sit on it all day and I haven't noticed any deflating at all! (which is surprising! most other seat cushion don't seem to get back their plumpness) I use this seat cushion on my office chair. I sit about 6-7 hours a day continuously. This cushion really gives me the support I need to get through my day without excessive back pain.

B00Z4TCMNK,Kanger Subox Mini Starter Kit - Black Edition,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"From someone who's been into vaping from the very beginning, and I mean 6 years ago with the last three ciggy free I'll add, this is absolutely the bomb!  I must have a small suitcase filled with mods, tanks, and juices galore and nothing so far has equaled this setup.  My previous goto vaping rig was just a nemesis with a Plasma rebuildable dripper.  Loved how easy it was to work on and making my own coils let me tinker it just right to get the perfect &#34;hit&#34;.  Problem was always carrying a juice bottle and dripping constantly.  That and about a week (very heavy user here) later, i'd have to replace the cotton and start over.  The Subox is going to change all that.<br /><br />First of all, the mod part is small, fits the hand easily and doesn't look ridiculous.  It's so compact!  Has all the features of about everything else out there even though it's not Temp controlled.  Love the fact that I can switch out the 18650's easily and quickly, unlike the KBOX it's just a magnetic cover.  it does have a mini-USB input if you want to charge your batteries that way.  I won't but I guess if my NiteCore ever goes out, it's an option.  The buttons are rubber and the screen is rotatable.  Would be nice if you could see your resistance without firing, because it goes back to zero's as soon as you release the button.  Changing batteries doesn't Reset the system, nice plus.<br />The tank is supposedly re-designed, but I can't tell.  The only thing that's different is the resistance of the OCC now comes in 1.5ohm and the standard .05ohm.  Haven't tried the 1.5 yet, but I'm thinking it will be like the &#34;old school&#34; style inserts.<br /><br />I think the thing that has got me so stoked is that this is going to be a very very repeatable experience.  The wife still uses the old style Ego systems and its so hit or miss.  Every battery/tank combo has just a bit of a different flavor/experience.  My rebuildables were similar.  Fresh rebuild, great... end of the week, ehhh... so so.  Plus the voltage of battery dropping also changed the flavor.  So far, the Subox is consistent.  To change it, i have to adjust the wattage.  Bingo.  OCC starts to gum up or whatever, pop in a new one.  Bingo!  That's what i'm after now...consistency without the headaches of tinkering and yet the power of my most awesome build.<br /><br />Hands free, the best investment I've ever had in the vaping world.  I got it on sale at cigabuy for under $50."

It operates on two AAA batteries and it measures your pulse and your blood oxygen level.  It comes with a nice carrying case with a Velcro flap closure.  On the back of the case is a belt loop and a plastic ring for a carabiner (Carabiner not supplied). It also comes with a nice neck lanyard so you can easily carry it without using your hands and you know where it always is.<br /><br />It comes with a nice bright display that is easily read and you can rotate the readings by pressing the power button. To take a reading:<br />* Insert your finger<br />* Press the power button<br />* Hold your finger still<br />* If you need to then press the power button to rotate the displayed readings.<br /><br />Taking a reading is fast and easy.  My wife's mom developed a very bad case of pneumonia last winter and actually was sick for months.  She had trouble breathing and we got her an oximeter to monitor her O2 levels in her blood and she kept a record of it for the doctor.  If it went too low she went to the hospital.  Readings below 90% are considered low and when she got to 86% it was time to go to the hospital and be checked out.  At 88 years old you don't mess around with pneumonia.  Low blood O2 levels can cause damage to your body, dizziness and fainting.  We went through that with her illness.<br /><br />This is a good product and it worked well.  I rated it at 5 stars.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. A review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the sample but I stated that if I provided a review that it would be fair and honest."

This is great for people who are having trouble using the more common, saw-style flossers, or for those still using a roll of loose floss but can't get to the back teeth. The string is thin, but thick enough that it won't break easily between your teeth. I found these at Walmart years ago, and they no longer seem to carry these Oral B flossers around here. (You're saving about $0.30 per pack with this purchase, buying them through Amazon here instead of Walmart.) I am so glad I can find these online - and they last me 8 months with these 8-pack deals!"

It seems to work quite well but you must be patient and let the roller do the work.  If you press too hard (as others have said) it'll stall on you & it doesn't take much pressure to do that.  It really worked fine for me as far as removing or smoothing out the rough spots on my feet.  The trouble I had was when I attempted to remove the battery cover, the bottom piece that locks it on, fell off on me.  When it came off,  it scattered some tiny sealing rings along with a thin plastic wheel (hopefully that was everything).  I've tried and tried but I can't get it back together to where it stays on.  So, if I can't figure a way, mine's shot.  Lastly, I can't find a customer service phone number anywhere."

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"I have three kids who've had mild eczema for years but all three had an intense surge in inflammation about five months ago and we've been struggling to control their itchy, bleeding, horribly red rashes ever since. I'm sorry to say this cream hasn't done anything for them yet. It's only been a week of using it so I haven't given up hope yet, but it's certainly not been the miracle cream for us that it has been for so many others. Maybe if your problem is extra dry and scaly skin, this will moisturize it sufficiently, but with the deeper set problems of eczema, nothing topical can resolve it. I wish it were that easy. Also, two of my kids complain that it burns and hurts terribly. Granted, they scratch so much that they have open and healing wounds, so I'm not surprised, I was just hoping the gentle, natural blend of ingredients would not irritate their skin so much. Coconut oil is the only topical moisturizer we've tried that doesn't hurt to apply. Coconut oil doesn't help improve their eczema, but it moisturizes, at least. If we experience any difference after using this product longer-term, I'll update this review."

B008S4PW6M,Norelco AT875 Deluxe AquaTec Rotary Razor,Personal_Care_Appliances,3,"This is my first electric razor.  Previously I used a 2-blade Gillette manual razor.<br /><br />I didn't get any razor burn at all from the AT875, even the first times I used it and even having never used an electric razor.<br /><br />My main goal with this purchase was to save time.  With my 2-blade regular razor, it took me 5 to 6 minutes to shave my face (48 hours after shaving previously).  With the AT875, it takes me 4 to 5 minutes to shave my face (48 hours after shaving previously).<br /><br />The AT875 shaves quite a bit less close than my 2-blade regular razor did.  Shaving with the AT875 was about 12 hours less close than using a manual razor.  That is, if I used a manual razor then waited 12 hours, I would have a shadow similar to the one that I would have immediately after using the AT875.  For my taste, that is not close enough.  I would need to use the AT875 every day instead of using a manual razor every other day.  This means the AT875 is not saving me any time.<br /><br />I'm going to try a more expensive Norelco product next.<br /><br />There is plenty of battery life.  I've only had to charge it once every month or two, and charging is convenient."

B00UFU2IAK,SamJoy Pro Hot Air Brush Dual Ionic Styler Styling Dryer Combo and Ceramic Flat Iron Purple,Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"It arrived promptly, and I was so excited to give it a try....then, the fun was over.  I am so disappointed in the design and performance of this hot brush - oh, there is no air, so not sure why the title says &#34;Hot Air Brush&#34; - that's a misnomer.<br /><br />First disappointment - the plug.  It comes with an international plug, which would be good for using it overseas, but I'm in the USA....it does come with an adapter, so points for that - HOWEVER, it does not 'grip' the outlet enough to stay plugged in during use.  Any amount of movement of the cord will cause it to just drop out of the outlet - go ahead, try to use this without moving the cord (I couldn't).  Next, both prongs are the very same size (not the US standard), so you have no idea which way to plug it into the outlet to get proper polarity - unless, of course, you know how to interpret the &#34;L&#34; and &#34;N&#34; label on the back of the adapter.<br /><br />Next disappointment - the slider with the  &#34;LOCK and UNLOCK&#34; symbols.  I'm guessing it's supposed to lock the brush closed so you can use it mainly as a hot brush, and so it won't open to become a flat iron while you are using it as a hot brush (Why am I only guessing?  Because I can't read the enclosed instructions).  Anyway, you slide it closed, and all seems well - then, lift it up to your hair to roll your hair around the hot brush...but, wait - the slider has now slid back down on it's own to let the brush open, and you now have a flat iron ready to go.  But, wait, I want to use it as a hot brush....slide it over to LOCK again, lift it to my hair, and there it goes again opening on it's own.  Seriously???  The slider is so loose that it will move to UNLOCK on it's own with just angling the brush upwards toward your hair - or with even the slightest touch from your hand.  This can actually be dangerous, as you could unwittingly put your finger inside the open flat iron that your aren't expecting to be there.  So, someone please tell me how I'm supposed to use this without angling it up, or touching the handle with my hand?<br /><br />Next - and last disappointment (because I'm definitely returning it at this point) is the OFF / L / H slider button.  First, there is no indication what temperature L and H are, so it's a guessing game (hopefully L isn't too low to get the job done and H doesn't fry my hair).  I go to the instructions - which are completely in Japanese (?), I think, and it tells me that L is 160C and H is 200C.  OK,  stop / Google / remember 160C = 320F, and 200C = 392F.  No other temperature options to choose from.  Then, the fun part - if you manage to keep the brush closed so you can hot curl your hair (refer to paragraph above), or maybe you just want to use the flat iron - start by setting the temperature you want to L or H, then begin to apply, BUT WAIT - the temperature slider switch just moved....what?!?  Are you kidding me?  This slider is also very loose, and placed right where your hand placement is, and any slight pressure can cause it to slide, either to another temperature setting, or off altogether.  Multiple attempts to avoid this by holding the handle a different way were NOT successful.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being too detail oriented - but I don't see anywhere on the hot brush where it says SamJoy....also, nowhere in the literature that I can read - but, then again, as stated - it is NOT written in English.<br /><br />Does it have an Auto-Off feature?  I have no idea....because I can't read the instructions!  How can I find out?  I guess I could duct tape the plug so it wouldn't fall out of the outlet, set the temp to L or H, then lay it down carefully so movement doesn't turn it off, set up a timer, then watch to see what happens.... but, I've already spent 45 minutes trying to use it while constantly having to plug it back in / moving the slider back to LOCK so I can use it as a hot brush / giving up and deciding to flat iron my hair / wondering why it wasn't hot enough - because the temperature  slider turned it off while I was using it!  Argh!  Also, there's the 15 minutes collectively to unpack it, now  repackaging it so I can send it back.  That's a whole hour of my life I can't get back.  I'm done.n't hot enough - because the temperature  slider turned it off while I was using it!  Argh!  Also, there's the 15 minutes collectively to unpack it, now  repackaging it so I can send it back.  That's a whole hour of my life I can't get back.  I'm done."

This bench straddles over the tub so a person can sit on the edge, slide back, and lift their legs into the tub. Then they are able to sit to take their shower. It was a life-saver for my Mom after breaking her left femur. She thought she would not be able to take a shower again, because she's always had some difficult lifting her legs to get into the tub/shower. But a friend told me about this device, and it has been a huge help. You will need to have a shower head that can be lifted from the holster and used as a hand-held model so that you can stay seated during the shower. It takes the risk out of taking a shower in those of us who still have the standard tub/shower model."

B007BICWB4,ProDENT DIGITAL INTRAORAL USB DENTAL CAMERA IMAGING LAB EQUIPMENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"I'm using this camera as a mechanic's tool rather than as a dental tool.  It provides a much better picture than an electronic borescope that I paid a lot more for.  It won't reach some tight spaces that the borescope will, but it can be used to inspect a lot of hard-to-reach locations.  The built-in lights are very bright so it's good for viewing dark areas.  The software that came with it works, but I have been using the webcam software that came with my laptop computer because it's easier to capture still shots with it...all you have to do is set the camera type to &#34;USB&#34;.  My Windows 8.1 laptop recognized this device within a few seconds after I plugged it in.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the documentation is bad.  I'm still trying to figure out what the 2nd switch is for.  It's labeled as &#34;picks up the key&#34; in the user manual...what the heck does that mean?  Nothing seems to happen when I press it with the included software or the webcam application, but luckily I'm able to do everything I need with just the power switch.  I'm guessing it might have some function with some of the dedicated dental software packages.  It's no big deal, because this is a very useful camera with just the power switch."

B002B51358,GMS Med-e-lert 28 Day Automatic Pill Dispenser 6 Alarms with 6 Dosage Rings and 1 Metal Key (Clear and Solid Lids Included),Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"We’ve had the Med-e-lert for about 4 weeks now and it has worked better than expected.  We purchased this for my mother in-law who has dementia.  She has been able to adapt to tilting the Med-e-lert to get her pills.  For all I know, she does this many times a day but the pills are only available at the prescribed times that I set up.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that the instructions for setup are a little less clear than they could have been.  I was able to setup exactly what I wanted (2 times a day, no audio alert), but it took a couple times reviewing the instructions.  I don’t believe most 80+ year olds would be able to follow the instructions, so be prepared to set up the Med-e-lert for the patient.  The other item I wish the Med-e-lert contained is a “loading shield” that would help ensure that when loading the pills into the individual compartments the pill don’t accidentally fall into an adjacent compartment.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend Med-e-lert.  Considering the assisted living facility wants $26 a day to “manage” medication, this device paid for itself in less than a week."

I don't understand why people left that many good reviews.  The material is really thin as a thick women pantyhose. When I touched the product, I didn't feel I can trust this knee sleeve to hold my knee together or reduce my knee pain.  It did not have any presentation of $36 knee sleeve to make my life happier.<br />If I pay this much money, I will buy a pair of copper infused knee sleeves like COPPER FIT or COZY SUPPORT ( this is my favorite.)  They hold knees much better.<br />The packaging of this product was not good, material was not that exciting as the price they charge.  It didn't look it will hold my knee at all.  SO I return it.

B00N5HD340,Straight Razor,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Been using this professionally at work (Barbershop).<br /><br />Initial Impressions: Razor itself has a fairly good heft behind it. It feels solid and quality. Really good quality metal as well. I like that the shaft of the razor is molded and not cut from metal. My razor if in disinfectant all day and this means it won't rust. Important for something that is made to be I and around water. The bevel on the business end is well honed and gives a clear view of the blade while working. The only thing in not absolutely fond of is the plastic piece at the end of the guard. On mine it is rough and discolored but doesn't affect the function at all. I just prefer my tools to be well maintained and this looks a bit banged up so I worry about in furture having to replace the razor.<br /><br />Loading the blades: Blades are plentiful and sharp and fairly easy to load. Removing them when wet can be tricky but is pretty easy when you get the hang of it. 100 blades is a nicesize and will last me just over a month but the again I use this at work so most men thiswill last almost three months.<br /><br />The Shave: The razor feels solid and quality. In terms of heft, its the closest I've come in feel to a regular stropped blade.The wieght of the razor and the sharpness of the blades combine for a pretty effortless shave, no need to press, even when shaving coarse beards or scalps. I find the razor gives the best shaves when the hair is a bit longer than everyday stubble. The blade seems to grab the extra length and give a smoother shave.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy. Without that plastic piece I would say perfect. I'm not docking a star for that because it doesn't affect the function and may be just my razor"

B00Z4TCMNK,Kanger Subox Mini Starter Kit - Black Edition,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Every review I read about this kit said it was great and it is nothing less. I'm not much of a cloud chaser but it's nice to have the option to fool around with. Every hit is that of perfection. I can set this thing down into the 2 volt range and still take a better hit than any ego pen I've ever used, thus conserving battery,coil,and juice life or pick up the power into the 40+ watt range in the 4+- volt area and blow a cloud big enuff to irrigate the house. Either way every hit is so much more favorable and warmer than the ego pens. Then to top off the fine tuning you can go with temptress control nickel coils if you want. You also save money by using 18650 batteries and the ability to make your own coils; which is easier than you think and yet another customizable option. There is absolutely no reason not to have this setup, the value is insanely great. $70, $15 for 2 efest batteries, and $15 for a nite core charger option if you want but don't need because this mod has a USB charging port. $100 and you got a setup you'll be in love with, and so happy you bought.<br />I've found a new world of flavor and satisfaction with this mod."

Fitbit One does come with a bracelet to use the One for measuring sleep, but it was cheap and quickly got worn; in fact, I almost lost the device the first time when it fell out of bracelet while sleeping - so I stopped using to measure sleep after 3 months.  The app dashboard is nice, but I would go with a bracelet type device instead (what I wanted was not available at the time when I purchased the One). No complaints about tracking ability. Unless you like clip-on trackers, I would stay 'miles' away from the Fitbit One and go with a bracelet model."

I use this several times a day when it is hot and humid to check my blood oxygen level since I have asthma.  It is sooo very helpful - I know right where I am and thus what meds to take.  I am not a medical person, but when my husband was having unusual chest pain about eleven pm one night, after checking for pain in arms, clamminess, weakness, disorientation and breathing difficulty I used this to check his pulse, heartbeat and blood oxygen.  Those all looked reasonably normal to me, although blood oxygen was low.  I gave him over-the-counter meds for gas.  A half hour and two big burps later, he felt fine and went to sleep.  The next day we went to his Dr.  Results:  No unnecessary trip to emergency room, and a scheduled sleep apnea study."

It works great, and I put on as much pressure as I need. Once I put too much pressure on my shoulder. It felt great, but it was kinda sore the next day. It came with a chart with a bunch of pressure points, but I never really used it. I just use it almost like the picture, only with more angle, and I usually hold on to the two handles for leverage. I don't think that lady in the picture is actually using it. I think she is a faker! My guess is she doesn't know what a kinked up shoulder even feels like. She looks supple."

My physical therapist indicated that either this one or another would probably be best. The other one didn't appear to have as much adjustment, so I ordered the Serola. It actually has an amazing amount of adjustment possible. After fastening the belt low on ones hips, the tension can be tightened using the elastic elements, which fasten with velcro. If it feels too tight or too loose, it can be adjusted easily to remedy the situation. I find it comfortable to wear, especially for standing and walking. I loosen it a little when sitting."

There was minimal leakage....just a few dots on the seal of one of the jar, and most if not all of the gel itself was in all the containers. So why three stars? The gel is pretty pungent!! The odor is that of the acrylic liquid!! The main reason why I switched from acrylic to gel is the smell!!!! I don't know how effective these are in terms of longevity on nails since I gave them away, but in terms of delivery time and packaging...thumbs up."
B0006VJ6TO,Body Back Company’s Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Therapy Self Massage Tool - PARENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Works for me. I bought this hook, the Trigger Points fold out chart, and &#34;The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook&#34;.<br /><br />I had a frozen shoulder (left) a few years ago, went to a Chiropractor, had laser light therapy many times, and after about 18 months, it finally was close to normal.<br /><br />August of 2014 I realized my right shoulder was locking up. My nephew, a new Chiropractor, suggested a medical massage therapist who understands trigger therapy.  I went once. The therapist was great, but not available to me regularly due to schedule conflicts. She used clear silicone suction cups as well as essential oils and coconut oil, and massage to increase lymph flow and circulation into the corresponding trigger areas. I have not been the same since. There has been an increased speed of healing to my shoulder. plus, using all these modalities, I have treated other pain as well.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the helpfulness of the Back Buddy Self-Massage Tool to reach impossible areas when self-massaging.<br /><br />Do not over work the trigger points, as others have said. That will only make you too sore to continue the next day, escalating the problems."

B000FNDOFA,Estee Lauder MagnaScopic Maximum Volume Mascara 01 Black,Personal_Care_Appliances,1,"I ordered two of these mascaras.  The first one was great.  After I used it up (about 3 months later) I opened the second one and it was completely dry.  I contacted the seller because I think they only take returns within 30 days and they have not responded.  In this case with makeup, I could not open the second mascara right away to check because it dries out if you open it.  I am a makeup artist and know this is a no-no.  I wasted over $40 on a dry mascara.  Either it was super super old or already opened to dry out like that."

I must say that the quality of this razor for a cheap at it is was awesome. A great addition and a pleasure to use.

B000IG7Z7C,"MDF Sprague Rappaport Dual Head Stethoscope with Adult, Pediatric, and Infant convertible chestpiece - All Black (MDF767-BO)",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,I purchased this to replace a long used and treasured Hewlett Packard sprague rappaport that I have used for 30 plus years.  I rarely missed a murmur or lung sound with it but the tubing rotted away and could not be replaced. I researched and decided on this since I think double tubing helps me.  I have not been disappointed and rather wish I had done this before.  The acoustics are very good and I feel I still hear all the subtle sounds I need.  The ear pieces are very comfortable.  I did have to play with the adjustable ear pieces to get a  good fit.  The scope is light and easy to carry.  The tubing is longer but is better for that.  All in all very satisfied and hope this helps others make a decision.  The price is unbeatable as well.

It is a well-made product, and may work very well for some users, but I found it hard to keep in place and wasn't quite bulky enough to support good posture at work or in the car.

B00HES9CMS,"Viva Naturals #1 Best Selling Certified Organic Cacao Powder from Superior Criollo Beans, 1 LB Bag",Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"For chocolate milk- Nestles cocoa powder works best for me; the Cacao powder just wont mix in and stays clumpy.<br />So far, for brownies and pudding- Cacao powder is better.  Its not as strong as regular cocoa powder and therefore does not irritate any indigestion or heartburn issue I may have.  At least so far. And I think it actually may taste a little better in these two desserts. Kind of a silky taste vs the stronger &#34;harsh/acidic&#34; taste of cocoa (which is not meant to be taken negatively of cocoa).<br />I can't say as the Cacao is any better than the regular cocoa powder. It depends on taste and if you want a stronger chocolate or a more &#34;silky&#34; one. Hey, chocolate is still chocolate in the end, as long as its good quality chocolate."

B0054QJK0G,Blood Typing Test Kit Eldoncard,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"This is a one time use item. With that said, I screwed up on my first one. I believed I got A+ but the problem was I had too little blood on it. The reason why is that I wasn't using it on a hard surface and it rolled around. So I decided to get the 5 pack. I figure I could fail once, but not twice. And that worked for me. On my first go with this five pack I got it right. Had enough blood on the card, and it came out A+ like I originally thought. I might try another one just to be 100% sure or hand out these cards to others who might want to try.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with these cards. I managed to get the test right after my second try. If this is your first time every doing this and you don't have anyone else you know who tried it before, I would recommend picking up more than one. That way if you mess up, or think you messed up, you at least have some back up."

I love that I can get some nice chocolate flavor in my coffee without all those other ingredients that come with chocolate syrups, powders and the like. With this I can get my chocolate flavor and use whichever sweetener I desire and not have to worry that they have added artificial sweeteners of any kind to it. I absolutely love it. I also love that it is organic and GMO free. It is also gluten free, and free of artificial ingredients, flavors and colors. It is soy, egg and dairy free making it vegan as well. I have only tried this in my coffee so far, but I'm definitely going to try the vegan pudding recipe that is in the description, and also a chocolate cake.

I've been disappointed with memory foam and other brands of buckwheat pillows. This one is great because it's bigger than the average buckwheat pillow, and it has zipper opening which allows you to put more buckwheat in it later when the buckwheat gets ground down from use. Yes, buckwheat pillow users must beware of this! I had to learn the hard way..."

B00WLTPRYM,"Baetea Weight Loss Tea: Detox, Body Cleanse, Reduce Bloating, & Appetite Suppressant, 14 Day Teatox, with Potent Traditional Organic Herbs, Ultimate Way to Calm and Cleanse Your Body",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I just completed my 14 day TeaTox, and I'm sad it's over. I did not loose any weight from using this supplement. However, the 'detox' and refreshing ritual that started my morning was amazing. The tea was flavorful, but not strong and overwhelming, like some teas I have tried for the same effect. The ingredients are simple and are good stuff. I had no ill effects from drinking this tea on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. The package actually did last me the entire 14 days, which surprised me- I thought some morning I may have over estimated the 'dose'.<br /><br />The benefits I noticed from my TeaTox were: reduced bloating, and a refreshing and revitalizing start to my day. I am already pretty 'in shape', and only have the last couple stubborn pounds to lose for my goal. So while this tea didn't make me lose pounds quickly, I really did enjoy the ritual, the flavor, and the detox benefits of the quality ingredients."

B00NY42UWK,Personal Pedi Water Proof Electronic Hand and Foot File and Callus Remover,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,There are a lot of negative reviews on this product but people have to remember you are putting this on your skin. It is not a sand blaster.  It does work. It takes a fine layer of skin off the calluses and buffs  your feet to a smoother look.  It does stop if you apply too much pressure..but this is a safety feature.  Use on a regular bases and moisturize your feet afterwards and you will see a difference.  It is not an instant fix!

B007OUYX66,Remington Smooth and Silky Full Size Epilator (EP6010),Personal_Care_Appliances,2,"I bought this for around $35 at Walgreens about two years ago. I tried and tried to make it work for me but it would break off (act as a regular electronic shaver) about 80% of the hairs on top of going over the same area of skin 10-15 times to feel somewhat smooth. I'd either have to epilate as much as I shave because the majority of the hairs weren't removed or I'd cave in and shave after epilating. I just received a new emoji epilator this week for ~$65 and so far have high prospects for this one! You will be so mug more pleased forking over the extra $5 for the 72-tweezers emoji than settling for the lesser quality Remington.<br />FYI, you can use the same AC adapter on both!"

I bought this as a novelty light, I thought it might be 150-200 lumens. This light is actually about 400 lumens with a Olight rechargeable 650mah rcr123a battery. I also have an Olight s10r baton and this light is just as bright. I would say they are identical in beam shot. I love my Olight with the magnetic base, but for the money I would recommend buying this light any day of the week. This one comes with a regular battery and two rechargeable batteries and charger, you can't beat that! Buy this light you will not be disappointed!!"

B002C9MSAC,"OPTP PRO-ROLLER Soft Density Foam Roller - Durable Roller for Massage, Stretching, Fitness, Yoga and Pilates",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"This roller has the perfect density for myofascia release.  The foam gives enough under pressure to mold the the body, and exerting even pressure to the body part.  It does not exert isolated force onto a small surface area, rather it distributes the force over a wider surface area.  Hence the muscle and the connective tissues both benefits from increased blood flow and tension release.  Unlike the highly dense roller, that is popular, there is no pain involved.  Even if the roller passes over an body area, such as the lumbar region, which it should not, it is less likely to inflict pain and damage.  It is a great roller for anyone who is looking to use a roller on a regular basis either for muscle soreness and releasing tension."

B00JZK0AC4,1 Pair Pointed Ballet Shoes Toe Caps Pads Protector Gel ---Nude,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,I have really bad toe pain from my fibromyalgia and these helped a lot. They are soft and squishy and not at all stiff so you can trim them to fit. I won't be wearing another pair of heels without these. The only thing I might note as a caution is that they are relatively narrow so if you have wide feet it might be a tight squeeze.
B00ECV3XG6,Icetek Sports Folding Butterfly Flail Comb,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,"It is exactly what it says it is. For a novelty item, it is great. Unique and fun, sure to generate some fun comments. The comb, however, isn't good for much other than totally mangling your hair. It's mostly for show.<br /><br />From a flipping standpoint, the handles are too thin for my taste. Other than that, it seems to flip well, and took a month or so to loosen up to the point where I needed to apply locktite to the screws. Also, there is an obvious different in feel between the bite and safe sides of the blade, which is nice.<br /><br />Finally, do NOT believe the Benchmade logo on the &#34;knife's&#34; blade. It is a forgery, and a somewhat poor one."

I don't have a sweet tooth but wanted something other than tea to drink at night as I don't eat dinner, just toast with cucumbers or tomatoes and a drink.  I lived in Mexico and know all about the Aztecs putting a bit of chili powder and it gives it a very delicious flavour.  I use Cashew milk, Silk makes it and is non gmo, because it is super creamy and delicious.  It is quite filling and satisfying.  You can add sweetener but I like it just with the chili."

My daughter had a severe case of eczema when wax 2 months old and I even tried Aveno which helped a bit but once I purchased this cream and applied on my baby's skin within a couple of days we noticed all the itchy and redness went away and her skin was super smooth! She is 6 months now and I keep buying it for her and apply it on her skin daily after her bath! Her skin hasn't had severe eczema at all maybe few red marks on the arms or legs creases here and there but nothing serious! This cream works wonders and I will highly recommend it! I know it's a little bit to pricey for the little jar you get but seen my daughter happy and not bother or in pain cause of her eczema makes it worth to pay that price!

I would recommend E Toothbrush care."

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"This stuff is amazing! I wish I had taken before and after pictures to show the difference it made. I had begun developing ezcema on the inside of my arms in the last few months. My arms itched like crazy and often were swollen with huge welts. If the pollen count was high or I was exposed to mold, they turned red and itched so bad some nights I slept with ice packs. I tried steriod creams and multiple OTC products. I was taking Benedryl every four hours. I hadn't been as so miserable from itching since I developed PUPPP during pregnancy and had hives all over (I wish I had discovered Era Cream back then!). My arms are now itch and welt free. Yesterday, I was exposed to high mold and pollen counts  while deep cleaning things outside and immediately began to break out in hives. After I finished and took and shower, I put Era Cream on and my skin was back to normal within a few hours. This stuff rocks!<br /><br />Sure, $25 is a little pricey for a jar of cream, but is less than many of the ointments---ones that never seem to really work-- prescribed by my doctor."

B000H47GCO,The Original McKenzie Lumbar Roll by OPTP - Low Back Support for Office Chairs and Car Seats,Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"I love this.  I bought one for the house and one for my vehicle.  The firm is pretty firm, but I read that the regular was kind of soft.  It really supports your lower back.  In a cushioned chair, it's just right, but in a stiffer chair (or seat of the car) it's a little too firm and doesn't give enough to be comfortable.  By moving the seat back a little it helps.  It is well made and stays put.  I don't use the strap so I have to readjust it's position whenever I get up."

That's why I've avoided crystal deodorant for so long. Silly me - it really works, and you don't have to be a hippy, have long hair - but you can shave or not, no matter.<br /><br />So here's the other problem with crystal deodorant that this product totally solves - that big honking piece of deodorant. There was never anything to grab on to, except the crystal. And well, you know, you rubbed that under your arms and that was stinky, and no I have that on my hands, yuck. Crystal Zen did this super cool thing and put the crystal on a plastic base with a screw cap cover. Wow, it looks like regular old deodorant now.<br /><br />No more smelly crazy hairy hippies and no more icky touching your armpit on the crystal. This stuff is heaven. Yeah, it really works. It is odorless. It prevents perspiration. And it is super easy to use. What's not to love about this?<br /><br />The box is super pretty. Actually it is almost too pretty - you want to lay the crystal containers back down in their pretty satin home.<br /><br />The box has three things - a big stick for home, a travel stick for um, vacation, and a skinny stick for razor burn or toes (but probably not both - you know ick).<br /><br />This stuff lasts forever. The only odd thing, the crystal has to be damp. To solve that, put on your deodorant just after you shower, or dribble a little water on the crystal just before you use it. Pretty darn simple.<br /><br />A fee sample was provided for review."

B00XZJ2G46,"Vision Spinner II Variable Voltage Battery, 1600mAh",Personal_Care_Appliances,3,Came in the mail quickly and works great.  I had a usb charger from a Neos vape that has a tiny battery and tried it.  It worked great.  The battery feels good and works as expected.<br /><br />Update:<br />No complaints with the battery itself.  But the device broke.  There is a little metal piece in the middle that conducts the electricity.  I was removing top half and it came out.  It looks like the solder connection broke.<br /><br />I think this may be a result of not cleaning the device properly.  The top part can get sticky and it touches this conductor part.  Mine was cold when I tried to remove the top part so maybe it was stuck pretty tight and I just pulled it off.<br /><br />I ordered another one.  In the future I will clean it better.  I reduced the stars from 4 to 3.  I don't think things like this should happen.

B002C9MSAC,"OPTP PRO-ROLLER Soft Density Foam Roller - Durable Roller for Massage, Stretching, Fitness, Yoga and Pilates",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"My therapist recommended this foam roller, and for my upper-back problems, it has been a near-miracle.  I expect one should be guided by a professional when purchasing products like this, of course, but if your advisor recommends one, don't hesitate.  Relief is on it's way!  Such a simple tool, but so effective in getting at those small muscles right alongside the spine...the ones that are so hard to reach otherwise.<br /><br />This is a high quality foam, it gives just a bit when you lie on it.  The harder ones are less giving--perhaps a heavier person or a large man would do well with those.  This one is perfect for me.  I will be using it the rest of my life."

B0006VJ6TO,Body Back Company’s Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Therapy Self Massage Tool - PARENT,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 instead of a full 5 is because there is no instruction manual. There were maybe one or two pictures on the tag. I am a massage therapist and I am going to have to google how to use it properly. on a high note the price is much less expensive than if I were to order from Massage Warehouse.

B00M9ZOHKS,"UltraFire Medium Flashlight Holster Belt Carry Case fits Ultrafire 501b, 502b, C8 Flashlights, Classic",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,"Package arrived 3 weeks EARLY!!! Product is excellent, just as described. I prefer the 1 mode model over the multiple modes as I find it a useless hassle to toggle through the modes to use the flashlight. Some folks like the strobe (to attract attention in the woods, perhaps, and also for possible self defense as a blinding light). It's really bright, and I find the adjustable focus quite useful. Would gladly do business with this vendor (ultrafire) again, and would buy this model of flashlight again as well."
