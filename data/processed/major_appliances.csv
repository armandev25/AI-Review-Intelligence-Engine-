B005R597HA,Avanti 110-Volt Automatic Portable Compact Dryer with Stainless Drum and See-Thru Window,Major Appliances,5,Works awesome for apt size 110 dryer. Handles load from apt size washer just fine. It does take longer to dry. Electric cost savings over a full size 220 is worth the time. Does not add much humidity unless lint filter is full.

B008KTIGZ4,GE GTUP270EMWW Spacemaker 9.2 Cu. Ft. White Electric Washer/Dryer Combo,Major Appliances,1,"The dryer for this stackable unit destroys clothes.  A loose button is found almost every time buttoned up shirts go in the dryer.  The vent holes to the lint trap are very large, and just the right size for buttons to be lodge in to be ripped off.  I have had buttons destroyed and holes ripped open when the buttons get ripped off.  All they need to do is design a replacement piece and I will get to keep my buttons."

B004HXDLJ8,Whynter BWR-18SD 18 Bottle Built-In Wine Refrigerator,Major Appliances,4,"I've had this product for one year and it's has already stopped working.  I purchased the 3-year Smart Guard protection on it which at first, attempted to find someone to come repair the issue, but instead they are just sending me an entire new wine cooler.  So, I would highly recommend purchasing the protection plan, just in case!"

B00ODBTQ70,Supco DE0019A Dryer Heating Element,Major Appliances,5,Arrived quickly and was easy to install
B0055UBB4O,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,5,Didn't use it long so I can't attest to that but for the price it is extremely good looking and feels like a quality build. Just know it's small - you will not be nuking turkeys in this - and it's not super high wattage so it may take a bit longer. So if you must have your canned soup in 2-1/2 minutes and not 3 then this won't work.
B005NK21MM,EdgeStar 6 Place Setting Countertop Portable Dishwasher,Major Appliances,1,"Worked great until it stopped working.    Twice I've had one of these go out on me.  The first time I ran it without the water turned on (my fault, but it can detect that there's no water nd it keeps running anyway -- what the hell!) and it developed a leak.  I'd had it about 30 days and the company exchanged it for me.  The 2nd time I have been using it correctly with great results for about 1 year.  Then yesterday it started making a different noise than it usually makes -- it sounded like a pump was frozen up - and there was a burning smell.  And it again developed a leak in the bottom.  Disappointed.  It's probably past the warrantee now so I'll likely just have to junk it.  Not sure if I will get another one or not as they all seem to be the same brand available on Amazon so they may all have the same quality issues."

B0073B0YBO,"Bosch SPE5ES55UC 500 Series 18"" Undercounter Dishwasher With Stainless Steel EuroTub 46 dBA ActiveTab Tray Water Softener AquaStop Plus EcoSense Half Load Option: Stainless",Major Appliances,3,"I rarely do reviews, but wanted to let people know about the deceptive marketing on this dishwasher.  We did a remodel and due to space constraints needed an 18 inch dishwasher.  We replaced a Kenmore dishwasher rated at 50 db.  The Bosch sounds like a freight train in our kitchen compared to the Kenmore.  We couldn't tell the Kenmore was on, but with the Bosch we can't run it when we are home.  It drowns out the TV and forget about getting any sleep when it is running (the bedroom is on one side of the kitchen and the living room on the other).  Whoever rated this at 46 db must be hard of hearing.<br /><br />The plus side is that it has great features and cleans well.  The only other negative is that door doesn't let you prop it open.  I like to open it a couple inches after it is done to let the dishes dry thoroughly.  The Kenmore would stay in any partially open position, but the Bosch is basically full open or closed and there is no way to adjust the tension on the spring to operate the door."
B00M9N9D36,HOMEIMAGE Thermo Electric Wine Cooler for 12 Bottles with Vertical Rack - HI-12C,Major Appliances,4,"Note that this only chills to a low of 51 degrees. I probably would have bought another model had I realized this as I like my white wine in the mid-40s. However it does function well, is a very nice looking refrigerator, and I don't find it to be too loud like some other reviewers (maybe that depends on the surface on where it sits.) Also note that it only fits slim bottles of wine - anything that is a bit larger in circumference on the bottom only fits in a few of the spaces."
B00VLX20YY,Kalamera 28 Bottle Stainless Steel Freestanding Wine Refrigerator,Major Appliances,3,"Nice unit, however, only works with what I would say is standard slim wine bottles. Any bottle that is odd size will not fit on the racks.  So, to use the fridge for varying size wine bottles you would have to remove some shelves to allow them to fit which reduces the capacity.  I'm sending mine back, which has not been a problem so far working with Amazon."
B002W8GV8S,"Whynter FM-85G 85-Quart Portable Refrigerator/Freezer, Platinum",Major Appliances,2,"Great Size, Great Idea, Poor Product.  Decides to not cool on its own and causes everything to thaw out."
B00ASQVO5Q,SPT WC-2461H Double-Door Dual-Zone Thermo-Electric Wine Cooler with Heating,Major Appliances,5,"Keep everything at 55 degrees, and don't overstress it and it works great- after the first 4 weeks so we'll see."
B000UW20T2,Broan 422401 ADA Capable Under-Cabinet Range Hood,Major Appliances,5,"We love this cabinet hood and at the price we got it at, it was a STEAL compared to the local hardware stores. It was easy to install and it worked so well for our house."
B000TDD5OG,Koolatron Coca Cola 28-Can Fridge,Major Appliances,2,It leaks water out the door.  the carpet where it sits remains wet.
B00TLOVFU0,KITCHENAID FRENCH DOOR FRIDGE *BRAND SOURCE ONLY*,Major Appliances,1,"Purchased Dec 2012. In May 2015 icemaker quit working-had to be replaced at my cost. Used a kitchenaid recommended service company in NC (one of 2 in our area). August 2015 refrigerator and freezer quit working. Compressor was replaced by same service repair co.( under warranty). unit worked for  2 hours and then quit. Service company stalling on coming back. Call to kitchenaid was worthless. After they shame you because you didn't buy the extended warranty.(expect a fridge to last more than 3 years) they explain that it is after all &#34;manmade&#34; They refuse to admit there is a problem with this unit. Any suggestions on how to get a recall going? I would give it zero stars, but amazon won't let me."
B00VRUEEXQ,35-6780 Pump For Maytag Washer,Major Appliances,5,"Yes, this was just what I needed to get the old washer humming again.  It did not fit the cabinet exactly, but I took a chunk of metal out of the back of the cabinet and it went in nice as pie,"

B00F21F2KK,NEW PART 9704230 GENUINE FSP OEM FACTORY ORIGINAL BLENDER DRIVE COUPLING FOR KITCHENAID AND WHIRLPOOL - REPLACES PART NUMBER 831718,Major Appliances,5,"I bought this to repair our KitchenAid blender, model KSB5WH4. I could have purchased the part from several suppliers ranging in price from $4.86 to $9 and most charged a little more for shipping. This part from Amazon does seem to be the same factory certified part as described and the package says &#34;made in US&#34; which is nice. Very easy replacement.<br /><br />The coupler on our blender broke apart, that is, the hard, black rubber part broke apart and so only the metal core/insert remained on the blender. I read a few online instructions on replacement and then watched a few youtube videos showing the replacement. Instructions are included with this part and includes a few photos. removal of the old coupler is even easier than the youtube videos show.<br /><br />The coupler core appears to be made of aluminum and is screwed onto a hardened steel shaft. The instructions require you to insert a flat screw driver under the old coupler and just pry it up a few times, rotating your position until it comes off. Because the coupler core is aluminum, it's really just prying the threads up which give way to the harder steel. Once off, you remove any bits of aluminum threads that came off. Then simply screw the new coupler onto the threaded shaft. You can and just need to hand tighten it, counter clockwise. The normal blending motion/direction tightens the coupler further. It literally took me all of 90 seconds to complete the whole replacement."
B00MVVI19I,"Midea WHS-87LW1 Compact Single Reversible Door Refrigerator and Freezer, 2.4 Cubic Feet, White",Major Appliances,4,"Works fine, but came out of the box dented in several places. It is pretty quiet, gets nice and cold, the door seals well, and there is lots of room inside. It is a great choice for putting under your desk at work. Just don't expect it to be pretty."
B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,5,"I purchased this as a gift for my parents, who frequently take their camper to the lake. They LOVE this ice maker and are constantly telling me how easy it is to use, and how quickly it works. They highly recommend it."

B00FBJCIZU,SquareTrade 4-Year Large Appliance Protection Plan ($0 - 250),Major Appliances,5,I will never hesitate to purchase the square trade protection plans.  Our Sharp AQUOS 70&#34; TV died at 13months.  Square Trade had a list of options for replacing the TV to us in 24 hours and a new TV here in our home within a week of contacting them.  This is a service organization that understands and appreciates what it means to service their customers.

B003O4QDWS,Speed Queen AWN412 3.3 Cu. Ft. White Top Load Washer,Major Appliances,5,"I love this machine! and the matching dryer too!<br /><br />Ok to set the record straight. About 4 years ago I fell for the &#34;all about being green front loader&#34;.  I bought an LG Front loader...It has been one of the most miserable 4 years of doing laundry imaginable. I would have never expected such an absolute nightmare. My laundry room has been stacked sky high with clothes that stink so bad that I would have to re-wash them four or five times until they were even wearable. I tried everything, I called the manufacture and begged for guidance! After multiple washings, I would resort to filling the bathtub and soaking all of the dark clothes. I even turned to using bleach - which I haven't used in decades. I couldn't take it anymore. I bought the Speed Queen AYN412 and the matching Dryer. I couldn't be happier with my new SPEED QUEEN I LOVE IT!. I would highly recommend this product.<br /><br />I received my new Speed Queen Washer and Dryer four days ago. It is fantastic! Yes... It looks and acts old-school. (It is true that my neighbor did kind of snicker when she saw it and even more when I told her how happy I was about my new Washer and Dryer) But I love this washer and dryer set. The clothes come out clean smelling and the towels are so fluffy! They look and feel like they have been actually washed. I know right? Imagine that! The clothes come out of the dryer warm and mostly wrinkle free. I can put in as many clothes in this machine as my old LG Front loader with no problem.  I have washed 16 loads of wash in 4 days. I have washed everything from white towels to washable delicate silk and even pantyhose.... Every load - Perfect every time! AND you might want to sit down for this... It takes 50 minutes to wash AND dry a load of laundry. Yep this working mom is very happy about that.  GOODBYE crappy - beat the heck out of the my clothes LG Front loader... Goodbye Forever - we are never never ever getting back together..... P.S. ... As far as the water savings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me.vings... are you kidding? one load being washed five times only to be sent to a full bathtub doesn't look like any kind of savings to me."

B00TKHBU0I,"LG PAIR SPECIAL-""WILD CHERRY RED"" Ultra Large Capacity Steam Laundry System with Matching Pedestals, and ELECTRIC Dryer(WM3370HRA_DLEX3370R_WDP4R X 2)",Major Appliances,5,"I have only had this LG Pair for about six weeks.  The underneath storage drawers came with this set and I feel that I receive a great deal.  As far as performance, so far amazing!  With a large household, I believe we have cut our time in half at least for washing and drying and the cloths look and smell clean.  The units are very quiet; our laundry room is next to the kitchen, next to open den and you cannot hear them during operation.  At first we did have a rocking motion from the washer; however, we failed (at first) to level with a level and very important on the feet of the washer and dryer is to adjust the feet, level and use the locking bolt on each foot.  Once we leveled the machines and used the locking bolt to lock each foot in place, we had no additional rocking problems from the washer.  We are following all of the operation procedures for the machines, if you have not owned a front loader before there are a few additional maintenance/clean out producers one must incorporate in bi-weekly and monthly routines, but other than this they work as expected and above.  I hope this continues for many years and maintenance and breakdowns do not plague us as I have read about on a few reviews.  My two sets before this LG Pair was Roper sets and they each lasted over 10 years each with few easy maintenance problems (a couple of replaced heating elements on the dryer; very simple to perform on a Ropers).  It may be unrealistic, however, I do hope to come close to 10 years of few maintenance problems with these LG's also (I realize there are more parts, digital, etc).  They look and feel quality made.  For the present, I am very happy with the pair and their performance."

We had the dishwasher professionally installed, and ran a test cycle. A little more than half way through the cycle, it beeped and gave an error message. I called customer service number and spent two hours in the circle of hell known as voicemail carousel, cut-off, call back, runaround, &#34;try this number instead,&#34; and so on. Finally got a repairman out, twice now, and it still has not run through a complete cycle without shutting down with an error message. It has now been 3 weeks since we bought it, and nearly 2 weeks since we had it installed, and we still do not have a working dishwasher. Update: After the backordered parts were installed, it immediately sprung another leak before finishing a load of dishes. More parts have been backordered. It has now been 46 days since I ordered this, and it has never run through a cycle. Electrolux has refused to refund, but Amazon is considering making an exception to their 30 day return policy since the backordered parts kept me waiting."

Front Load Washer with Vibration Control System Stay Fresh Door Seal WashSense Technology Express-Select Controls and Delay Start,Major Appliances,1,"So disappointing. Like another reviewer said, you constantly have to tear this thing apart when it stops draining, to unclog the filter. Now sure how quarterS and socks and undies manage to even get in there, but it's a huge pain in the ass!! 3rd time in 2 1/2 years that I had to unclog it only to realize the pump burned out! Oh and the door has had a leak since day one but of course, the repair men say whatever they can to avoid actually fixing it. Needless to say, after 3 visits from them, washer is still broken and out of warranty. GARBAGE!"

B003V9XR9I,"Samsung SMH9187 1.8 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Microwave with Sensor Cooking, Electronic Touch Control,",Major Appliances,1,"Same as everyone else, NEVER buy Samsung major kitchen appliances. I spent over $5K a little over 5 yrs ago. Dishwasher died in 18m and had to be fully replaced, Bosch working great since the. Refrigerator ice maker died at 2yrs, replaced and 2nd one just died at 3yrs old last month. Now SMH9187 microwave, that worked okay at least for 5 yrs in very light use, just died with broken door latch (like dozens of others hit). Fixed it per YouTube video by drilling new hole in plastic door latch and moving spring. That worked fine but in middle of night 2 days before that, microwave beeped in middle of the night on its own, then had E-13 on the display.   Reset it and now getting either the dreaded SE error or worse, it literally in under 5 minutes suddenly turns on by ITSELF showing something about cooking a potato! Now after seeing hundreds of similar complaints including that microwave caused at least a couple fires I'm now scared to leave it plugged in when not home, especially since I have 3 pets. Going to replace with nice GE new one. Last GE microwave lasted over 12yrs!  Also had 2 Samsung LCD TV's, 1 BluRay and 1 DVD player all die in under 2yrs too.  NEVER, EVER GOING TO BUY ANYTHING FROM SAMSUNG AGAIN!!!  Shame on them for fooling me more than once but beyond shame on them for their utter lack of safety and concern for their customers!"

B00RL014P2,The Laundry Alternative Super Compact 5.5 Lb. Capacity Full Automatic Washer with 3 Year Full Warranty,Major Appliances,4,"Where do I begin? I received my brand new lil washer machine today. Couldn’t be more excited to do laundry! After 12 years of schlepping to the laundry mat, dodging cars to cross the street, counting pennies to convert to quarters,  I finally invested in my own private washing machine. I have to admit, this is my 3rd attempt at buying a portable washing machine in the last month. One of the main reasons why I made a decision to make this type of purchase is that the laundry-mat disgusts me. After 10+ years of going to the Ol coin op, I finally had it. I did a load of wash, and when it was done, I took my clothes out and everything was covered in Dog/ Cat hair. EVERYTHING was covered. IM highly allergic to dogs and cats and thankfully the laundry manager was there when this happened. She gave me quarters to re-wash my clothes. Unfortunately, the second wash didn’t get all the hairs out, so after drying, I took a lint brush to every article of clothing, to try and get what pet hair was left. It was a complete nightmare! And so from that, I went on Amazon, read a million and 1 reviews and bought the Wonder Washer.  WHAT a JOKE! Then I made a second purchase for the E-clean… NOT fun either. SO, after more research and more re-reading of all those millions of reviews on every single portable washer unit on Amazon, I made the brave decision, took a leap of faith, and got The Laundry Alternative Super Compact 5.5 lb capacity. Ill be honest, I was really trying to save money with the other 2 previous purchases, but what I got was a huge headache, ruined clothes, broken machines, time lost, lint monsters, and sprained wrist from wringing clothes (not really, but you get my drift). In the long run, many months from now, maybe even years, that this Laundry Alternative Super Compact will eventually pay for itself.  So my review, to be fair was going to be a 1 star, maybe 2 stars. The machine I received came poorly packaged and the unit had a crack on the inside motor area. It still leaks from the body, but that’s due to it being cracked and from it being poorly made/ assembled. Here’s is a brief rundown of my first impressions: -Received item in a non-secured box. The bottom of the box was taped on, and was not part of the box. -When opened, broken pieces of foam came out of the box and were all broken inside the washer where the motor and wires are. I carefully vacuumed the inside to gather as much of the broken pieces of foam. -I thoroughly inspected the unit, and found 1 major crack on the motor cover, and the front of the unit being unevenly put together. -The exterior outside unit was dirty, with dirt marks around it. -When lifted and carried to kitchen to hook it up, there were swishing sounds of water. -Major water leaks from base and side exterior. No water leaks from hose/ faucet hookup. -A random black plastic block fell from the inside. I have no idea what’s it for. It had grease on it.  AND here is my simple comparison bullets: Laundry Mat: Pros: -Get multiple loads of wash done  Cons: -Dollars and Quarters…. -Other people’s clothes you don’t know being washed in that very same washer you just washed your clothes in. Do you really think your clothes are being cleaned? -Time consuming -Cant really leave to tend to other errands, or do other things. You spend roughly 2+ hours at the laundry mat, not including fold time.  The Laundry Alternative: Pros: -Don’t have to go to laundry mat -NO more scrounging for quarters! -You can stay home and search Amazon for more cool apartment gadgets to buy to make your life easier. -Pretty quiet. -Once you get the hang of it, no babysitting! It’s all automatic and really does get your clothes clean -Pretty Compact and doesn’t take a lot of room. I have a very narrow small kitchen, so for me, IM going to need to store it someplace else. -It’s a wash, rinse, spin cycle! -NO SMELL! The WW and e-clean had this toxic smell to it, this didn’t. That was my fear, as I’m highly sensitive to chemical smells and IM very happy to report, no toxic smell (at least mine didn’t). -Fast Delivery, was delivered by USPS on a Sunday! Ordered on a Friday :)  Cons: -Very Flimsy gooseneck holder. Kept coming off the draining hose and wouldn’t stay put when water would drain. WATER went everywhere. I had to manually hold it in the sink every time the rinse cycle went. Eventually, after the 3rd wash, I took one side of the gooseneck holder and attached it to the black water hose (the one from faucet to laundry unit) and this kept the draining hose to stay in the sink (NO more babysitting ) -35 lbs is not too heavy, but not light enough (actually more annoying) to store and bring back to kitchen. Needs caster wheels that lock in place when using washer. -Only able to use cold water via the hose attachment. IM sure you could get a different hose that's suitable for any temperature, but that should have been done by the manufacture. -No gentle cycle -Pretty much everything is plastic made. The inside washing area is stainless steel. The agitator is plastic. -It will literally take you all day to do your laundry, as it’s very small and can only wash roughly 5.5lbs of clothes. So best used for daily, every other day light wash. (took me 5 hours to do 4 loads with clean up, hang drying, troubleshooting etc, those 4 loads would of been 1 load at the laundry mat) - The power cord is slightly too short. Needs about an extra 12 inches to it.  The initial leaking caused a major mini flood on my kitchen floors. The gooseneck hose holder is very flimsy and didn’t hold the hose properly onto the sink. When the rinse cycle started, the drain hose started doing the cobra dance and the drain water went all over everywhere. It was the first time for me to use this machine, so getting to know it was not friendly.  The washing portion of it was great. Very little to no lint left on the clothing after wash. Spin cycle does a great job, makes hang drying fasterand NO wringing of the clothes to get excess water! Even with the cracked motor and water leaking from the sides, I was able to wash 4 loads to test it out. With the first two loads, when the rinse cycle finished, dead small flies and foam particles came out. The second load, it was more just foam particles. The other two loads were to re-wash some of the towels I washed in the 1st & 2nd load, since the first load leaked and spewed water all over the floor that caused a mini flood. My kitchen rug was soaked, not only did I use towels, but went through an entire roll of paper towels. Water was everywhere. The only good thing that came out of that was my floor had an unexpected cleaning.  The good news is, that mini flood was not from the assembly of the actual unit, that flood was from the drain hose. After the 2nd wash, I was pretty familiar with how to navigate this bad boy, and by the 4th wash, I was sitting on my couch for 30 minutes while that load washed.  The unit still leaks water from the bottom (probably not safe because of the wiring and plug, and from the top/sides. IM not going to use the machine again, until I get a new one.  Overall, even with the broken machine, IM REALLY impressed with how well the machine handles clothes. IM impressed with the high quality faucet/hose attachment (I say this, because of the E-clean experience I had, you had to hold the cheaply made hose onto the sink while water filled the wash). No leaks from my sink faucet, no leaks to the washing unit (ALTHOUGH, when detaching water hose from washing unit, it will leak, so make sure you have a towel handy). I also love that the front right leg is an actual rotating wheel, which adjust to level with floor. It keeps the unit from shaking in spin cycle. -Once you understand and troubleshoot the trial and errors of the machine, you will not need to sit and babysit. The first 3 loads I did, water went everywhere, and I literally had a flood!  I do believe I need a new unit, one that issecurely packed carefully  and assembled properly so it doesn’t leak. I'll probably update this review once i get a new machine. My apologies, as this review has turned into a story. Right now its at 3 stars, almost 4 as I really love this machine now. But until a new one comes into my life, it will stay at a 3.  *update* Impeccable customer service! 4 stars for that. This really is a wonderful little washer and even though it says cold water only, you can use Warm Water to get a deeper clean."

Very quiet which is a significant plus. Purchased at Home Depot and bought the 5 year warranty. Also extended the manufacturers warranty by 1 year with my credit card. P.S. Did not purchase on Amazon even though it was slightly less expensive.   In trying to decide on refrigerators we discovered that many of the reviews are brutal. Usually either noisy, break down, or the ice maker fails. This includes Samsung, Kenmore, GE, Whirlpool, Kitchen Aid, and LG. Have never seen an industry so beset by problems which also include poor service, expensive parts, denial of responsibility. Quite frankly this counter depth refridgerator by LG had the best of all the worst reviewed, but so far we have been pleasantly surprised. Will review again in a  few weeks to update."

B012P95E5E,*Appliance Shield*New Top Rated Surge Protector*Protects Appliances From Damaging&Costly Voltage Spikes/Dips*Works Great For All Large Appliances*Refrigerators/Freezers/Dryers*Best In Class 20 Amp*,Major Appliances,5,"I live in rural Hawaii and our power goes out frequently, sometimes for days at a time.  To keep our food from spoiling we use a combination of generator power or I run it off a deep cycle marine battery charged with solar panels and a 2500 watt power inverter.  That opens up a lot of potential for voltage anomalies and I don't want to fry a $1200.00 refrigerator.  This surge protector is unlike any I have ever seen before.  Usually they just look like an oversized male plug on one side and female on the other.  I've always wondered if they even work.  This unit is different. I like the translucent housing so that you can see the circuit board and electronics inside.<br /><br />I saw some other reviews that indicated they had problems figuring out the unit because the instructions were in Spanish.  Mine didn't come with any instructions though the label was in Spanish.  I'm not sure I understand the confusion because you plug this unit into the wall, plug the appliance into it, and then turn it on.  There is a dial on the back for adjusting down the AC voltage, that is not a feature you would need to use in the USA, just leave it set at the factory setting.<br /><br />One thing I did wish I knew is what is the phatom draw of this unit.  If anybody knows I would like to know as well.<br /><br />I found a coupon code for this product on the internet that got me a small discount on the price and they requested (but not required) that I would leave a review whether it was good or bad.  I'm going to buy another one at full price for my chest freezer."

Cleans great, and I really like how silent it runs. Then just 6 months after the warranty expired, my $1000 panel ready dishwasher door came crashing down hard enough to shake glasses on the counter above it.  One side of the door spring system had broken. I was hoping a $10-$30 piece of plastic and maybe some rope (probably costs $0.50 to manufacture) would fix it.  Sad to say, the springs on these dishwashers are held in place by a thin layer of plastic molded into the whole dishwasher unit case bottom.  This thin plastic fin had broken so there was no way to keep the spring in place. The fix means replacing the entire unit bottom...<br />Bosch said it would be $100 for someone to come out and diagnose the problem. Then they would have to return for service.  This all just happened, and is not yet resolved. I will update once it is.  I had hoped more money meant better product, longer lifespan... but this doesn't seem to be the case."

That is before we found out these portable little things existed. The Avalaon Bay 26 pound ice maker takes up very little space on our crowded countertop, and it makes more than enough ice for the 6-pack cooler we use on those afternoons by the pool and for our evening industrial strength beverage. I estimate it will pay for itself in 6 months vs buying ice at the campground (if it is offered) and we can store it in much smaller baggies in our always crowded freezer. I wish I'd had one of these things years ago when we only used our travel trailer on the weekends."

I like the layout, the third rack, and the large silverware basket. My biggest complaint is that there is no &#34;extra rinse&#34; option. An extra rinse option is highly desirable because most new dishwashers conserve water to a fault. As a result, after a wash, the dishes have a slippery feel to them. I suspect this is because not all the soap is rinsed off. I'm all for conserving water, but not if it means I'm consuming soap residue every time I eat or drink.  Update: If you are generous with the soap, there is a soap smell after a normal wash cycle is finished. If you run an express cycle after the normal cycle, the soap smell/residue is removed. A rinse cycle can work, but the rinse cycle does not provide a drying option, so your dishes are left soaking wet."

I wish I had.<br /><br />Cooling system gave out once the unit was 3 months our of warranty; however, KingsBottle would not honor the problem.  Customer service was absolutely horrible.  I've never experienced anything like it.  Once they indicated they would not warranty the unit I asked if they had a service agent that could fix it.  At first they said they did as I was so close to their headquarters; however, I never received any information.  When I called back, they said they did not have an agent, but would send me some recommended repair companies.  Again, I never heard from them and had to follow up.  I explained that I was waiting on a recommended service company and again they told me they would get back to me but never followed up.  I called every day for a week but could not get a simple recommendation.  I finally gave up and searched for a company on line.<br /><br />The machine looks nice and worked well for the most part for 15 months (although some of the minor issues are not corrected as outlined in the manual and had to be figured out by trial an error).  I'm extremely put off by the product's quality and support network.  This is proof that price does not equal a good experience.<br /><br />I've never written a poor review before on any product but am so thoroughly disillusioned with this unit, I wanted to warn others to stay away from it.<br /><br />I'm not sure who posted the five start reviews on this product.  I hope they are sincere; however, for me I'm hoping I can get at least four more years out of this product before I discard it for something of higher quality with a company that can offer an acceptable level of service."
B004SUXZ5U,Avanti 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Counter Top Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,5,"I have had my wine cooler for a little over one week.  I love it.  There is absolutely no noise from it.  The very first day, it did run a lot and made a bit of noise as it was working its way down to the chosen temperature.  I am wondering if those who stated it was noisy have it too close to a wall, or a cupboard causing vibration.  It is very classy looking.  Guests love the appearance as do I.  I have mine on the floor next to a china cabinet with lots of air space around it.  I do not believe that this would fit on most countertops.  I have not seen counters in kitchens that did not have cupboards above.  It does NOT get warm on the outside at all.  I am finding that it does not run often at all and keeps a steady temperature.  I live in a desert area, so it gets very hot here (triple digits) and I do not run my AC all the time.  Frequently the inside of my house is 80 degrees and the cooler still does not run too much.  I have mine set at 58 degrees and it holds this steadily.  The price is also very good.  If I had a little more room, I would order another one so that I could have one for whites and one for reds.  I am using this one for reds.  I am considering getting a couple of these as gifts for family members."

B00074TB9U,Broan 30-Inch Allure Range Hood,Major Appliances,5,"I purchased this to replace a micro-hood and was thrilled to find it in bisque color since it matches everything else in my kitchen.  I decided against buying the bottom of the line hood since this one is enclosed and easier to keep clean.  We installed it vented outside and instructions were pretty clear.  The day after installation my husband realized the hood was ½-inch higher in front than in back (due to our cabinets and the wood blocks already there, nothing wrong with the hood) and it meant that we could easily SEE the halogen bulbs whether standing in the kitchen or sitting at the counter.  UGH!  To fix it would be more work than we wanted to do.  However, I realized that the halogen bulbs got very hot very quickly and the light it gave off was actually brighter than I wanted.  After reading on several sites about people using LED lights (which Broan does not recommend) I thought I'd try them.  After trying PAR20 bulbs that definitely stuck out longer and shielded the bulb from view—but gave off too warm a light, I tried a couple of GE Bright White PAR16 LED bulbs that I purchased at my local Walmart.  Because they are shorter the look is MUCH cleaner, and the light is brighter/not as yellow.  Yes, they flicker a bit on the low setting, but I typically plan to use the high setting for the light since I have real night lights in the kitchen for that purpose; also these lights have a 35-degree angle beam which are almost perfect for covering my entire cooktop, although a little less bright in the back but sufficient nonetheless.  And they stay cool while on.<br /><br />As for the fan, as others have stated, I find the low setting VERY QUIET but not very effective; the high setting works great, especially ducted.  (NOTE:  when installing vented outside, make sure to alter the baffle so it does NOT recirculate the air inside.)  The hood is very attractive with minimal lines; in the Bisque-on-Bisque everything blends nicely.  I love having more vertical space between my large cooking pots and the hood.  And the price was good.  Broan customer service was wonderful--we were missing the mounting hardware, and after calling they sent out the hardware the next day via UPS.<br /><br />P.S.  Amazon's customer service with this order was EXCELLENT.  UPS inadvertently shipped my hood to Canada; Amazon sent out another hood overnight so it would be here for our installer; we simply refused the UPS delivery of the initial hood when is arrived.between my large cooking pots and the hood.

The ice comes out wet and stick a little , I use meat tenderizer to separate ice while holding zip-lock with one hand in the air. You will not crush as much ice as if you put the bag flat on the surface and beat it. Wait 24 hours before operating it , the gas in the ice maker should settle down.

So I've been lugging the big stuff tot he laundromat and doing the lesser stuff by hand at home and seeing an entire day of my already limited free time dsiappear. I felt I couldn't get the soap out of the clothes (could have been just my imagination) though, saw this and thought using this blue thing would be akin to beating my wash against a rock. So I sent for one. Got to try it today and it really does work very well. The instructions say to pump it up and down for &#34;a few mintes&#34; and that's all but I find I don't even have to do that many minutes. I pre-soak the clothes in only a little soap so the wash doesn't need much soap at all, and then the rinsing is fast and easy. The blue thing (which is what I'm calling it) does all the heavy work, kind of like churning butter. As others have said, the wood handle is a b... Read more"

Capacity, in White",Major Appliances,5,"I too bought this washer from a local retailer after my 1995 Amana top loader (manufactured by Speed Queen, btw) began leaking from the bottom tub gasket after 20 years of service and thousands of loads for a family of five. I wanted a no-frills machine that would give me another 20 years of service that was manufactured in the USA, and this one fit the bill. I watched a YouTube video on how to adjust the height of the water, and another video on how to bypass the mechanism that stops the machine when the lid is lifted, both easy hacks on a non-digital, old school machine.<br />I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
B002B4FY72,"LG 30"" Induction Cooktop",Major Appliances,5,"Unfortunately, LG may have discontinued this, but I've had mine for six years now, and it has performed extremely well. It is easy to use, easy to keep clean. Yes, if the controls encounter moisture, it may flash E-1 and shut down. That happens maybe twice a year and is easy to wipe dry and turn back on. I would rate that as a minor, minor drawback. The major advantages are reliability, speed of cooking, intuitive control, lock feature, and the &#34;bridge&#34; which works very well with the heavy-duty griddle that comes with the cooktop. That was interesting -- they had this neat feature -- a linked bridge that can supply continuous heating across the left two elements, but no pans commercially available that could use it, so LG provides the special pan. The whole breakfast can be cooked on that large size, heavy duty, stainless steel griddle. It has become the favorite pan here at the house."

B002UYSHMM,Haier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer,Major Appliances,5,"At first, I was really disappointed.  The washer leaked from the connection into the machine and also, it seemed, from inside the housing just below the connection.  I used it anyway, placing towels strategically to soak up the leak.<br />When an appliance repair guy came to fix my stove, I asked him to take a look at the little washer.  He tightened up the connection, and voil&agrave;:  that fixed the problem.  The point is, I really thought I had that connection as tight as it could be, so iif your machine is leaking you might want to get a stronger person with an actual plumbing tool to tighten the connection. The spongy gasket thingy is really squished now.<br />I bought this specifically for fulling knitted wool fabric.  It works beautifully for this purpose, even though it is a pulsator type, which is generally considered to produce inadequate agitation for felting.  If this one ever breaks completely down, I would buy another one."

B00D18S5VO,Electrolux Laundry Bundle | Electrolux EIFLS60LT Washer & Electrolux EIMED60LT Electric Dryer w/Pedestals - Titanium,Major Appliances,1,"Hate It!! This is my first experience with an Electrolux product and I was looking forward to owning one. I purchased the 4.3 Cu. Ft. Front Load Washer with IQ-Touch™ Controls featuring Perfect Steam in March and had it installed on the 23rd (2015). It is now April 25 and I hate this washing machine. I wish I had chosen a different brand. The technician has already been out once because I had a slow water leak coming down the front of the washer. The tech discovered there was a defect in the door, which created a gap large enough for water to pool inside the door. A new door is on order but it took two weeks for it to come in. I was approximately one week away from the new door arriving and the washer started having other issues. The washer developed a knocking sound when it went into the spin cycle and rocked more than it did when first installed. The spin cycle is so loud it is not conducive to a hold a normal conversation if near the washer or trying to watch television in the next room. In fact, the shaking and noise levels are so much louder and disruptive on this Electrolux then what I experienced with the 10-year-old washer I replaced. Even when on its &#34;last leg&#34;, my old washer never sounded or behaved as my new one does. This is horrible; I cannot believe I paid for a product that is already having numerous problems within the first month.<br /><br />Update:  Horrible Product -1st Review No longer on Electrolux Website<br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Interestingly, my first review (above) of this washer was removed from the Electrolux website; it was in no way inappropriate and 100% true. I am on my 2nd new washer in 6 months and the new one is now broken down with the same problem as the first one. I was told the pulley system slipped, causing a hole in the wash tub, which means I am once again without a washer for weeks at a time while waiting for repairs."

B00CXNLJ5M,"Bosch SHP65T55UC 500 24"" Stainless Steel Fully Integrated Dishwasher - Energy Star",Major Appliances,3,"Good dishwasher. I like the layout, the third rack, and the large silverware basket. My biggest complaint is that there is no &#34;extra rinse&#34; option. An extra rinse option is highly desirable because most new dishwashers conserve water to a fault. As a result, after a wash, the dishes have a slippery feel to them. I suspect this is because not all the soap is rinsed off. I'm all for conserving water, but not if it means I'm consuming soap residue every time I eat or drink.  Update: If you are generous with the soap, there is a soap smell after a normal wash cycle is finished. If you run an express cycle after the normal cycle, the soap smell/residue is removed. A rinse cycle can work, but the rinse cycle does not provide a drying option, so your dishes are left soaking wet."

B00IY7B5CS,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,1,"I really wanted to like this thing. And I had all these plans for filling up coolers and stuff but by the time u have a full load, half the ice is melted. Also the ice is pretty wet so if u r trying to store it, it ends up being a solid chunk. I think it is impressive that it can make 9 cubes as quick as it does, but just the overall volume is not enough to make a real difference if u were to make ice cubes manually w a few trays. Additionally, it is pretty big and takes up a lot of counter space.<br /><br />The poor review is not due to the machine not working properly, it's just that I can't see a very practical use of this thing. It just doesn't make a lot of ice fast enough."

Only on Amazon did I feel this was a bit slower than normal. I generally receive Amazon purchases within a few days. Overall, shipping time was satisfactory.<br /><br />The real issue was the Kenmore Range. The wires that attach to the element &#34;turtled&#34; back into the rear compartment because they were 2&#34; too short. Once the strain was relieved, the relaxed wires ended up in the rear compartment. I opened the rear inspection panel, rerouted the wires and attached the element without further issues. However, the sheet metal was sharp and I wouldn't recommend attempting this job without a pair of gloves and needle-nose pliers.<br /><br />This isn't the fault of the element, it's a manufacturing issue with the oven."

The unit than turned off and everything smelled and tasted like burnt plastic. My wife's breast milk all went bad in the freezer. The worst part was the customer service. They did not listen to my issues. They dismissed my concerns for my wife's breast milk. They were unable to send a service tech for 4 days and expected me to &#34;deal with it &#34; until than. They offered me $150 for a mini fridge when GEs lowest price mini fridge was $220. I spent over 3 hours on the phone with them. I bought the unit from lowes and called them and they got a new fridge to me the next morning. Bottom line Lowes was amazing and have earned a customer for life. GE is by far the worst appliance company in terms of customer service and quality. PLEASE NEVER EVER BUY A GE PRODUCT EVER.

B00LUZUOS2,Fisher Paykel OR30SDBMX1 30&quot; Freestanding Gas Range with 3.6 cu. ft. Capacity 4 Sealed Burners Anti-tilt Bracket Flame Failure Electronic Clock and Timer: Brushed Stainless Steel with Black,Major Appliances,4,"This range exceeds all expectations for its appearance, value and seemingly sturdy build.  I have not had any difficult with the manner in which the burners ignite as other reviewers have.  You do have to hold in the knob for about 3 seconds to ensure the flame does not go out but I don't find this annoying.  The burners themselves are powerful and easy to adjust once you get accustomed to the function of the inner and outer rings of fire.  The oven does put out copious amounts of heat into the kitchen through the vent at the top of the oven door and it heats up the control knobs quite a bit.  I guess that is what you get when graduating to this high powered performer.  The oven heats up very quickly and the broiler works great.  I took delivery of the range during a southern California heat wave and the first time I fired up the oven it super heated my kitchen.  This range would be more appreciated during a cold night in Minesotta but probably not where I live where it rarely gets below 40 degrees.  The most troubling aspect to this range and the reason I did not give it 5 stars is the lack of adjustability of the height.  If you compare it to almost every other range in existence you will find that its maximum height adjusted with the feet is below what most installations will require.  So my installer had to custom fit some lumber under the legs of my new 3K range to get it to the proper height. Unacceptable.  I guess the designers were in a coma when they configured the dimensions.  Also, they stupidly fit a HUGE power cable that sticks straight out from the wall plug at least 3 inches making it impossible to slide the range anywhere near to the back wall.  So again, my professional and very astute installer had to run an extension cord. He cautioned me to remove it if I ever need service because F&P would void the warranty. By the way, the flush designed power cord pictured in the F&P manual that would have worked perfectly is no where near the style that is supplied with the range.  Again, a real disappointment from a design perspective.  I got the range for $2999.00 and a promotion included a $600.00 over the range microwave for free.  So this was a real value if you compare it to other brands where the entry point for just the range is probably $3500.00.  I also got the F&P refrigerator and DishDrawer which both work great.  This is a very stylish suite of appliances."

I like the layout, the third rack, and the large silverware basket. My biggest complaint is that there is no &#34;extra rinse&#34; option. An extra rinse option is highly desirable because most new dishwashers conserve water to a fault. As a result, after a wash, the dishes have a slippery feel to them. I suspect this is because not all the soap is rinsed off. I'm all for conserving water, but not if it means I'm consuming soap residue every time I eat or drink.<br /><br />Update: If you are generous with the soap, there is a soap smell after a normal wash cycle is finished. If you run an express cycle after the normal cycle, the soap smell/residue is removed. A rinse cycle can work, but the rinse cycle does not provide a drying option, so your dishes are left soaking wet."

Pay attention to the notation that the number of bottles of wine you can place in the unit may vary.  I have wine from an Oregon Vineyard (Pinot) and putting their standard size bottle, plus some wine from South Africa can only get 20 bottles in the unit - not 28.<br /><br />It is an attractive unit and it did cool down in a very reasonable amount of time.  I still do not have the handle on the unit as there are no instructions on that - has screws and there are two holes for the screws on the front of the door, but not on the inside of the door so am having to contact customer service on that one."

I bought this Fisher & Paykel fridge e522ble4 on 9/12/2014. It completely stopped working on Wednesday 12/08/2015, 9 months later after the purchase.<br />I placed a call to Fisher & Paykel on Saturday 15/08 and they said even though they considered refrigeration as a priority service repair, they could only come two weeks later on 28/08. I explained that with two young kids the fridge was a necessity and they said they would call if they had a cancellation. No call and I called them on 27/08 to check at what time they would come the day after and they told me that the repairer was off sick and that the next available was now 8/09. Frustrating is not the word…<br />In total it will end up being at least 1 month before somebody from Fisher & Paykel comes to have a look at the fridge.<br />In the future I will avoid New Zealand or Australian designed fridges. It is like cars - they are not so reliable and very expensive. I will be smarter and go to German or Asian brands."

B004SUXZ5U,Avanti 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Counter Top Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,4,"I've had this wine cooler for a couple of months now. Overall, it does the job it was intended to do. I keep both red and white wines in it, by keeping the temperature at 56F. That's borderline low for red, and borderline high for white, so it's not perfect. But, I was prepared for that because it is a single-zone cooler after all.<br /><br />My wife and I don't drink that much wine (2 bottles a week, more if we have guests over). I had planned to purchase a second unit, so that we'd have one for red wines, and a separate one for white wines. But, we're happy with the borderline temperature setting so far.<br /><br />The spacing of the metal racks is barely sufficient for regular-size bottles. We have problems with any wine bottles that are wider or taller than usual, even if they are 750 ml. We end up having to use the space with no racks in order to stack wide bottles directly on top of each other. We can't place any of the longer-necked bottles (some white wines are like that).<br /><br />My biggest complaint... Read more"

B00LIAP2ZY,"LG WM3997HWA Ventless 4.3 Cu. Ft. Capacity Steam Washer/Dryer Combination with TurboWash, TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System, NeveRust Stainless Steel Drum, Allergiene Cycle in White",Major Appliances,1,"I really wanted this combo unit to work. The unit has great options for washing clothes and is quite. However, the dryer feature did not work or was malfunctioning on the unit i received. What I noticed about the drying feature on my unit is that I could hear it spraying bursts of water into the machine when it was on the dry cycle. So the result was hot wet clothes when the machine cycle ended. How wet you ask? They were soaked, I could wring out the water and get them more dry by hand then this machine could do on an 3 hour dry cycle. Like others who purchased this machine I knew that the clothes would have a damp feeling after washing/drying. That is not the case with this machine, my clothes are soaked. Perhaps your still thinking I did not &#34;really&#34; know how to use this machine. For a test I put in completely dry clothes into this machine, turned on just the dryer and can you guess what happened? Thats right! The clothes came out wet! Weird... Anyways, I did some other tests and I found out if I removed the drain hose to a bucket on the floor the clothes would come out almost dry but I had to keep an eye on the bucket because it would fill up twice before the dry cycle ended. The reason why I moved the drain hose to a bucket is because the water did not create a hydro-lock and I let gravity drain the water out. LG did however do their best to help me. They do not have a rep that repairs in my area so I have to return this one and they will cut me a check. But like I said earlier I really wanted this machine to work and now I have to go through the motions of replacing it. Unfortunately, I do not have the confidence that I will replace this unit with the same one. I will look elsewhere.<br />If you're on the ropes about buying one yourself then consider yourself warned. I'd say you have a 50/50 chance you'll get a unit that will give you damp clothes over soaked clothes. Either way you're getting one or the other. And I was one of the people who said to myself &#34;I can live with damp clothes if they dry when I hang them up.&#34; Yeah right, good luck to you!yself &#34;I can live with damp clothes if they dry when I hang them up.&#34; Yeah right, good luck to you!"

B001ASSFR6,Miele KM5773 36 Induction Cooktop 5 Cooking Zones,Major Appliances,1,"The induction technology seems to be still working out its bugs, and unfortunately many people are having to buy without actually trying out the controls. Here are some things we discovered about the Miele after it was installed.<br /><br />1) It can take anywhere from a minimum of 3 to 7 punches of the touch control buttons to get the burner on and to the level you wish. You have press to turn the whole unit on, press to turn the specific burner on, and press for the specific setting either once more (for very high or very low) or multiple times if you want a medium setting like 5.<br /><br />2) The controls are not at all intuitive.  No guest at our home (we tested about a dozen) was successful in operating the stove without a tutorial.  The markings on the touch pad do not give you a clue about what should be pressed and in what order.  You cannot disable the lock on the whole unit, and few people realized that the stove unit needed to be unlocked before you go to a specific burner.<br /><br />3) The controls are not very sensitive.  Some people's fingers produced very inconsistent responses for some of the touch screen buttons. Almost everyone made the mistake, when first trying, of not holding their finger on the pad long enough for it to respond.  It takes a lot longer than most touch pads on most other devices.  But for some fingers it took multiple presses on a button to get a response and in some cases would not respond at all.  There was a lack of touch responsivity  about 30% of the time.  The technical support staff, when called, recommended changing the room lighting  (it's light sensitive) and &#34;using the middle finger&#34; instead of the index finger, but these did not really help.  There is actually a youtube video showing some of these problems with another model: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KItZaAM8Jtk.<br /><br />4) The unit and all the burners arbitrarily shut off quite frequently. A misplaced touch can do it, as can the presence of some object on the top of the range.  Then you need to go through the multiple punch routine to get it going again.<br /><br />5) The top itself, while shiny and cool looking, is also so slick that pots and pans can easily slide around, sometimes sloshing out their contents.<br /><br />The good news is that Miele did agree to take the unit back and give us a refund. Still I urge the industry to rethink the controls on these units and make more working units available to customers to try out in showrooms to see if it really suits them.bject on the top of the range.

I started doing my own research on Ionized Alkaline Water machines and really liked the price and quality of the Life Ionizer and started communicating with the company about their machine. The customer service was outstanding and has been for the past three years since buying my machine. I share the water with friends and neighbors and they all really like the taste of clean fresh tasting water. The city water here in Huntsville Alabama has a lot of chlorine in the water. now as soon as I put a glass of tap water up to my nose to drink it when I am away from home I can hardly stand it. We cook with the water, make coffee and tea with it and believe me you can really tell the difference. I personally recommend the Life Ionizer machine and hope you will take a serious look the the companies line of products if you are thinking about a water machine. My 86 year old mom will only drink the Ionized Alkaline water now. She has had several of her medical issues improve since she started drinking the water.<br /><br />One thing I forgot. It was a breeze to set up and get going."

B00NN0ZTI2,LG WM4270HWA TurboWash 4.5 Cu. Ft. White Stackable With Steam Cycle Front Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,5,"I purchased this washer 3 months ago. It replaced a top loader that crapped out. I couldn't be more happier with this machine. It has greatly reduced my number of loads by increased capacity. I follow the instruction manual to eliminate potential mold. When it spins, it almost completely dries most of my laundry. The only negative I have is that I needed the water hammer eliminators. They were 9.99 at lowes (1 for cold & hot). It would have been nice if they were included because from what I've read from reviews, it's a frequent issue with this machine. I can look way past that though. My 3-yr old had an upset stomach when he woke up.  He threw up on his sheets. We rinsed them off, but there was a red stain on them that I assumed would be there forever. I put them in this machine and told it to wash in the Sanitary Cycle. Result: Stain gone, and sheets sanitized. This baby is a game changer as far as time and money spent on doing the laundry."

Cans work perfectly in here, but if you have a 16 oz bottle you can fit one in here if you turn it corner to corner. This leaves room for a fruit cup, pudding cup, and a protein snack. It comes with a wall plug and a car lighter plug. I haven't used it in my car so I'm not sure how it will work with the heat of the car versus the cool of an office."

I live in a two bedroom apartment and this holds the perfect amount for two adults who like to eat. The fridge that came with our apartment is smallish and the icemaker in the freezer takes up a great deal of my frozen storage space otherwise. It works quietly other than a click when the compressor turns on. I had to adjust the temperature to get it right but was amazed that it was down to 0F after just an hour of being plugged in. This is a popular little freezer because of the price and with Amazon's free delivery, it was well worth the 2 week back-order that I experienced. Mine was delivered by UPS. There was minor damage to the very front bottom of the unit but unless you are looking closely it is really not noticeable. Similar chest freezers are a little more expensive, but delivery in my home town was about $50, so between the delivery and the savings on the price, I feel that this freezer is a very good deal. I purchased a freezer thermometer from Walmart that hangs nicely from the little basket and the temperature stays consistent."

Top Loading Portable Washing Machine, White",Major Appliances,5,"It arrived with a little dent, but it works much better than the washers in my apartment building.  Clothes are thoroughly cleaned and rinsed.  It's operation is much quieter than most washer, even when it spins, you can talk on the phone right in front of it without having to shout. Since I have had this washer I noticed that it's mechanism for off-balance protection is perfect.  The washer starts spinning slowly at first, and gradually increases speed (like a clutch does), this prevents the load from becoming off-balance.  I have never had an off balance load.<br /><br />The manual is poorly written however, here are the corresponding 6 cycles detailed in layman terms:<br />two 42 minute cycles (first one normal the second one permanent press).  The difference is in the spin time.  Normal 6 minutes permanent press 2 minutes;<br />one 10 minute cycle (faster wash speed but only 1 minute final spin);<br />one 39 minute cycle (normal cycle with two long soaks 6 minute final spin);<br />one 34 minute cycle (permanent press no spin); and<br />one 60 minute cycle (spin only)  I never use this will create wrinkles you will still have to press clothes with an iron.<br />I used it several times a week and it's thorough on cleaning and easy on clothes since it does not agitate."

I don't even mind that it takes forever to dry, or for that matter that clothes are slightly damp coming out - that is probably really good for the longevity of the garments. Hang something for an hour or two and it's great.<br />BUT - this unit gets really hot and emits a plastic-y smell that suggests to me I am being exposed to unknown chemicals from the electronics and plastics used in its manufacture. It might be because the unit is new, but I find this rather disturbing. I don't need to die of cancer to get my clothes dry. Not sure what I am going to do about this. If it doesn't abate in a week I will probably want to get rid of it.<br />I also cannot imagine that this is energy-efficient because like I said, it gets really hot and I don't think it's from the hot water."

B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,5,"The refrigerator ice maker cannot be used in our home because it causes flooding. My family and I use a lot of ice daily, especially me. The cost of purchasing ice at the store added up quickly - we went through two or more bags of ice each week at a cost of $2 for a 10 lb bag of ice. Easily we were spending at least $20 per month on ice. We purchased ours at Sam's Club for $99, so after about 5-6 months we have more than recovered what we would have spent on purchasing bags of ice.<br /><br />For those who have complained that their units do not work, there is usually a 30-day period to ask for a replacement or refund. Looking at the overall positive reviews, it would seem that malfunctioning units are the exception rather than the rule. The item that we purchased has worked flawlessly since we purchased it, more than a year ago.<br /><br />I don't know if everyone puts it to use in the same way. We use it to keep a full supply of ice in our freezer at all times. If we run low, we just fill the ice maker with water and let it do its thing. It only drops a handful of ice at a time, so if you were waiting for enough ice to fill your cup, you might get frustrated waiting. So we turn it on when our ice supply drops, and pass by occasionally to dump the ice into the freezer ice container. The ice maker will stop making ice and an indicator light will go on if the tray gets too full, or if the machine runs out of water.<br /><br />I saw the reviews of other ice addicts who were very happy with this ice maker. I too am an avid ice lover... and this ice maker has been a treasured appliance in our home!"

Two day later we got a notice that the item shipped (on a Friday) and was due to arrive between the following Wednesday and Saturday or some 6 to 10 days later.  However, the next day (Saturday) when I checked to see where the package was it said it was delivered Friday &#34;left on porch&#34;  the delivery note said -- so it arrive the same day it was shipped.  Luckily this was not a $1,000 piece of electronics.<br /><br />The item itself is just what we thought it would be and looks very similar to the one we replaced, although my wife thinks the metal is a little thinner than the original.  Might be, but the last one lasted almost 20 years, so if we can get close to that on this it will be well worth the money spent."

B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,5,"I recently bought this for my husband's birthday (along with a cooler) and had my doubts about how much ice we would get from a portable machine. This lil bugger cranks it out! In one day I had enough to fill the bottom shelf of my tall freezer. (about 1 large 10\15 lb. bag along with 2 clear storage buckets (sorry don't know the size). The bag is enough to fill up half the cooler I bought him (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004PCHHVE/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is a very large cooler (holds 72 cans). You do have to keep an eye on it if you want to store ice for later use, it dumps ice about every 10 minutes (about 9 cubes) and fills the tray in 1 hour (almost on the dot), however the ice will melt if not removed when the tray is full (the machine will stop making ice until the tray is dumped).

B00O2N3JDG,Danby products,Major Appliances,4,"First of all, based on the other reviews here, I got really lucky that mine arrived without damage. The packaging is very bad, only 1/2 inch of styrofoam for a 70lb fridge doesn't seem like the best shipping idea. That being said, I am very pleased with this item.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It's quiet.<br />2. It looks spectacular.<br />3. It holds a ton of drinks. I can fit 75 12oz cans of soda and 24 8.4oz cans of red bull in this fridge. That's nearly 100 cans!<br />4. It locks, I did not know that when I bought it, but it was a nice surprise!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. With the way it's packaged there is a good chance of it arriving damaged.<br />2. The spacing between wires on the racks is way too wide, where some 12oz cans only sit on 1 wire.<br />3. Do not remove the sticker on the bottom of the door. It leaves a horrible residue that does not come off easily at all.<br />4. It is taller and heavier than you may expect it to be. Read the dimensions carefully, and it is close to 70lbs. You will need either a dolly or 2 people to move this.<br /><br />The cons are mostly nit picks. This is a very good fridge for the price and I am very happy with the purchase. If not for the packaging this would be 5-stars."

B003GFAY5C,Broan 30W in. QP2 Under Cabinet Range Hood,Major Appliances,5,"This Broan NuTone QP230 Range Hood is Great!  We replaced a 12 year-old basic Broan with this model and it is &#34;night and day&#34;.  First off though, we had to order it through a different source after waiting for 12 long days and no response to two messages from this distributor!  The other source was $20 cheaper and got it to us in three days.  Before mounting the unit, the first thing I did was replace the 4 x 50 watt halogen lights with LEDs that would only consume 24 watts, total. find the here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LGZCVSW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />The installation was straight forward and simple, especially since the 3-1/4&#34;x 10&#34; damper fit matched the old opening.  One person can complete the install if you work by the directions and do not skip any of the preparations.  If you replace the halogen bulbs with LED's (highly recommended_, use the suction tool to gently pull the lamp just a bit, and immediately start to turn one way or the other.  They come out easily, so do not force anything.<br /><br />Performance compared to the cheap, basic unit:  boiling a big pot of noodles with the old unit, at least half of the steam would go up and over the front end of the range hood.  with the QP230, I did not see a bit of steam escape the suction of this bad boy!  And it's quieter to boot!  So if you're think you want to add this or any other Broan range hood, look into other ordering options; at least until Amazon recruits a more responsible seller."

B00K5UJRDG,Kawaii Portable Compact Small Clothes Dryer KA-D40 Apartment Size 110v stainless Steel Drum 8.8lbs Capacity/2.65cu.ft.,Major Appliances,4,"I got this after using a Panda Washer in my condo unit for a few weeks.  My goal is to not have to use my building's laundry room or a laundromat. I am a single guy and I have a mix of office clothing and casual and the usual mix of sheet, towels, etc.  I was becoming unhappy with air drying because many items were a little stiff and scratchy with air drying (mainly towels and jeans).  I just got the dryer last night and I have dried two loads.  Here are my initial impressions.<br /><br />It is slightly larger than my Panda washer which does 6-7 lbs of clothes.  It is heavier and is constructed of steel like a real washer, but of a thinner gauge of metal.  Seems very well constructed, given the price and that it is essentially &#34;portable&#34; or small-sized.  Seems like it will last.  Well packed in a large box with padding.  No damage in shipping.  No strange chemical or plastic smell at all out of the box, unlike the Panda washer.<br /><br />I had no 'loose belt' issue (read some other reviews) -- the dryer worked immediately.  The noise level:  louder than the Panda Washer (which is very quiet) but quieter than a hair dryer by a fair margin.  In fact the sound does sound sort of like a cross between a regular full sized dryer and a hair dryer. I was able to watch television in the next room (no closed door) without a problem, and I'd say this is no louder than machines in a laundry room.<br /><br />I load my Panda 6-7 lb washer close to capacity every load. As a single guy, I do laundry once per week with my Panda washer (highly recommended).  By the time the second load was washed, the first load in the dryer was dry enough for me to take it out of the dryer.  The first load was dried with the 'low heat' setting.  The second load, towels and such, I left running and went to bed.  The timer was set to about 30 or 40 min with the &#34;high heat&#34; button pressed in.  This morning, my towels were soft, and bone-dry.  So were the things I washed in the first load -- and everything was SOFT and FRESH (I used 'linen' scented liquid fabric softener from Target) -- unless air drying, which leaves everything wrinkled.<br /><br />With darks or not very soiled colors, using the Panda, it takes me 3 minutes to fill machine; 8 minutes wash time; 3 minutes to drain and fill for rinse; 5 minutes for rinse agitation; 5 minutes to drain and spin.  That is  about 24 minutes per load.  At high heat, with a not-over-filled dryer load, your first load will be close to dry by the time your second load is ready.  This will depend on fabrics and your heat setting.<br /><br />I specifically got this model, which is slightly larger than the smaller 5 lb load capacity dryer which is also available with slight variances from various vendors, because I usually do between 2-4 loads when I wash, and I want the extra size to dry up to 2 loads of wash in the dryer simultaneously. So far, I am very pleased, because it seems that this thought process is accurate.  I expect that my stuff dried quickly because the dryer was slightly loaded.<br /><br />A commercial or full sized dryer would do the job in about half the time, but those other machines are capable of much higher temps.  This little guy cannot match the big boys, but if the goal is to be productive in your home while taking care of laundry, this is a great route to take.<br /><br />Between the washer and this dryer, I have now spent $500 or so on the 'at home' laundry experiment.  I fretted over whether I really &#34;needed&#34; a dryer and whether around $300 for the dryer was too much money.  My worries are gone.  This machine does a beautiful job of drying towels, clothes, and does it  a bit quicker than the time estimates I found in other reviews.  The container will easier fit my King bed sheets or 2 Panda washer loads, yet the dryer is still small enough to be only slightly larger than the Panda and I can move it easily (though I am a pretty big and strong fella, so your mileage may vary).  Great device.<br /><br />I have purchased a steam iron and a ironing pad and have decided to learn to iron and avoid dry cleaners as much as possible, since my experience is that white shirts end up missing button, stained, or wear out too quickly at a commerical laundry.  I never thought I'd become a laundry hobbyist...lol...<br /><br />Only con is that I wish that it were cheaper and perhaps on wheels to make it easier to move."
B004SUXZ5U,Avanti 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Counter Top Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,5,"I'm very happy with this wine fridge for how it fits my lifestyle. It's the perfect size to keep in the kitchen to always keep a few bottles of different types of red wine ready at the right temperature for myself or guests without being some massive thing taking up a lot of space. It is very quiet, I've never noticed the noise that it is supposed to make. I also really like how you can stand up a couple of bottles in the bottom left of the fridge. This works really well when you open a bottle but don't finish it, so I just vacuum seal it and stick it back in the fridge for next time. I used to always hate leaving a half open bottle on the counter or in the fridge and never having it at the right temperature. This is the perfect solution.<br />Also the customer service from Avanti was very good. When the fridge shipped, the drip tray at the back under the power cord was broken. I called them up and they shipped out a replacement part straight away. The fridge probably shouldn't have been... Read more"

B00PIYEUHW,Panda Portable Compact Laundry Dryer Apartment Size 110v Stainless Steel Tumble,Major Appliances,5,"I have an apartment, and this was like a god-send. I don't have a washer/dryer hookup, so I got a Panda washer and a Panda dryer.<br />At first, living in Texas, I was concerned about the heat factor when drying clothes in an apartment. But it wasn't a problem. I got a window fan for the hottest months, and I use that in conjunction with the vent to expel the hot air.<br />But realistically, it doesn't get nearly as hot as I thought it would.<br />It's also nice and quiet. I've had it running while my husband was taking a nap and he didn't even notice.<br />Finally, given the above two qualities, it doesn't take long to dry clothes at all, and the clothes come out fresh and crisp.<br />I would heartily recommend also getting wool dryer balls and essential oil (to put on the dryer balls) to go with this dryer. They remove lint in conjunction with the dryer's own lint filter, and the clothes come out even fresher. Plus, if you get a nice essential oil (I like French Lavender, personally), your clothes smell really good coming out."

Call this Thermador customer service phone number 800-735-4328. This is the only way to get parts and service.  Set aside hours, weeks, months.

After much trouble with the gas piping, we got these babies installed and were ready to use. I’m so stocked about this set, they’re awesome. It was time for a new set as our other ones were almost ten years old, and when I got that yes I was so happy. We choose the gas over electric this time, and I am so happy we did, gas dries so much better than electric and your bill will be so much less to.<br /><br />The front loader washer is pretty sweet for sure. Everything is digital, just set to your settings, and will always remember what you picked, tells you how long it will take. Sings a song when it turns on, when its done, and sings a whole song to. Buttons are huge, and you only need to put your finger on the button and will set it. The only thing I wish was the digital board had a back-light for night-time using. The door is huge, opens and closes easy. The area for detergent is easy to reach and the bucket can sit on top and drip in easy. The door does lock shut, but there is a button for emergency release in case you have pranksters in your home. We also requested the bottom stowaway for each of them, they are huge and holds detergent, softener, and more easily.<br /><br />The front loader dryer is better with gas, and will save you money. I love how the door opens the same side as the dryer so you can pull items from the washer to right into the dryer. The drums of the two are the same size. They have bedding, delicate, wrinkle free, static free settings on the dryer. The dryer also is digital, with easy tapping buttons, tells you how long the dryer will take, and has a song for turning on, off, and when done. The settings per the two, with about the same settings, with the dryer taking only ten minutes longer, and these are both the simple settings. The dryer lint trap isn’t the best, super hard to take the lint out, as there is no place the release the actual plastic when you take it out, to remove it, so little fingers are the best to use for that.<br /><br />All in all we love these Samsung washer and dryer sets, you can find them retail for $999.99 and you can get rebates back up to $200 if you were to buy them at Home Depot or Lowe’s as seen on a commercial.  These are a huge step up to what we head top and front loaders from 2006, reaching almost ten years old, so these babies are AWESOME. I love the stowaway on the bottom of each one, making less clutter and messes. They are as tall as I am, maybe a bit taller, and I am 5’9. They look heavy, but they’re actually pretty use to move around on cement flooring.take it out, to remove it, so little fingers are the best to use for that.<br /><br />All in all we love these Samsung washer and dryer sets, you can find them retail for $999.99 and you can get rebates back up to $200 if you were to buy them at Home Depot or Lowe’s as seen on a commercial.

B004SUXZ5U,Avanti 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Counter Top Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,4,"I've had this wine cooler for a couple of months now. Overall, it does the job it was intended to do. I keep both red and white wines in it, by keeping the temperature at 56F. That's borderline low for red, and borderline high for white, so it's not perfect. But, I was prepared for that because it is a single-zone cooler after all.<br /><br />My wife and I don't drink that much wine (2 bottles a week, more if we have guests over). I had planned to purchase a second unit, so that we'd have one for red wines, and a separate one for white wines. But, we're happy with the borderline temperature setting so far.<br /><br />The spacing of the metal racks is barely sufficient for regular-size bottles. We have problems with any wine bottles that are wider or taller than usual, even if they are 750 ml. We end up having to use the space with no racks in order to stack wide bottles directly on top of each other. We can't place any of the longer-necked bottles (some white wines are like that).<br /><br />My biggest complaint... Read more"

B0073M80UK,Whirlpool WRF560SEYM 19.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"We had this refrigerator delivered on 6/9/15.  Within the first 10 days, the freezer got so warm it defrosted the ice and food. We called Whirlpool customer service and they sent out a technician a week later. The technician said he couldn’t find anything wrong and we should make sure the door was shut and the freezer kept full.  He also advised to get a surge protector made for appliances.  Everything done as recommended.  A couple of days later freezer temperature soared, we purchased a temperature probe and temperature in freezer would go above freezing and remain there long enough to melt ice and food.  We called Whirlpool customer service. The Technician came out. He called Whirlpool and on Technical Support's recommendation, he ordered a thermister, main controller board and wiring harness.  He replaced the items replaced 2 weeks later when the parts came in.  A couple of days later, freezer temperature rose long enough to defrost ice and food. Called Whirlpool again, they said they would need to send a technician out again. They said they had no record of the technician calling customer service, when in fact he called from our home in front of my husband.  A week later, the same technician came out.  He said he did everything he could.  He called Whirlpool Technical Support and this time was told to order a customer interface board.  A week later the part came in and the technician came out to install it.  He said if this didn't work, there was nothing more he could do.  A day later, temperature rose again, defrosted the ice and food.  We called Whirlpool customer service again and demanded a replacement.  We were told yet again, that they needed to send a technician out.  We will be waiting another week just for the technician to say nothing else can be done.  Do not buy this refrigerator or a Whirlpool appliance.  Their customer service is the worst!  We have had this appliance for almost 3 months and cannot rely on the freezer.  Cash outlay $1598.00"

The magnetic material is permanently deformed; heat does nothing to straighten it out (heat helps only on the vinyl material).  As a result the gasket never actually seals, and condensing, moist air, pours into the refrigerator and freezer. Once it's installed, you can't return it.  Very expensive lesson in lousy packaging.

But they have told they won't cover this known flaw bc it's more than 1 year old. The waster is 16 months old only. Samsung has come out w new dampers to fix this problem but you have to pay for labor and parts which is absurd given its a design flaw that caused them to design new dampers.<br /><br />In addition ,  I've already spent $140 to replace a rusted top cover as well.

B008UEJS7Y,"Golden Vantage 30"" Under Cabinet Stainless Steel Range Hood GV-R01-75 With Baffle Filter",Major Appliances,5,"One of the best investment I made given we cook Indian food at least twice a day :)  Fan/motors are very powerful and almost eliminates cooking smell. I like the auto-sensing feature which detects gas/smell leak. Many time it has saved milk/tea overflow because it turns on the fan which remind us to take an action.<br /><br />After a year, the gas sensor broke and I contacted customer service. They immediately shipped a new gas sensor. While inserting this gas sensor, it blew up the circuit-board and they shipped a new one immediately.<br /><br />In short, customer service is great. Thanks Alex."

They are easy to cut down to the length needed and stay put. Also easy to clean. I researched this item a lot before buying and took the chance with this one and I'm happy I did. I also like the fact that the McClure's show personalized care if there are any problems in the future with these seals. That helps buyers a lot.

So does my cat who watches them run through it because it's clear. I will have to replace it though because the wires are starting to poke out and I'm scared one of them will take one to the eye. BUT that is not typically what they are used for so that should not effect the products ultimate rating.

B003IWI7HA,Paramount 004402388000 Clear O3 Ozone Water Purifying System 004-402-3880-00,Major Appliances,5,"This unit was installed by my pool contractor and has performed flawlessly for many years.  Although I have a salt water generator, you could just have this and chlorine tablets for a small residual when the pump isn't running.  The bulb is replaceable.  No scum line around the tile.<br /><br />Haven't had to shock the pool water to make the chlorine useful again, because it provides a continuous shock.  If I notice algae, I generally let the filter take it out.  I do check the phosphate level and keep it near zero to prevent an algae bloom.  I add Kem-Tek Ultra Clarifier to remove algae if the filter isn't removing it.  My research indicates that the time it takes ozone to kill germs is something like 14 minutes, whereas for chlorine, it is 15 hours.  So when we are swimming, we make sure the pump is on."

B00KVMEFMQ,"SPT SD-2202S Countertop Dishwasher with Delay Start, Silver",Major Appliances,5,"Living in NYC isn't easy. Apartments cost a ton to rent, and space comes at a premium (in fact, apartments that have built-in dishwashers are often $100-$200 more per month, which adds up fast). Unfortunately, I'm also extremely lazy in that I hate doing dishes every day, or ever for that matter. It was getting to the point where literal mountains of dishes were cluttering my already space limited counters. I woke up one day, and decided this needed to change. I asked myself, &#34;What's the cheapest way to solve the problem of unending dirty dishes?&#34;. So I logged on my favorite dating app and got myself a nice girlfriend.<br /><br />I thought all my problems were solved. I was wrong. Very wrong.<br /><br />It turns out that getting a girlfriend actually INCREASED the amount of dirty dishes. I was shocked. Saddened. Deeply disturbed. Every night, I curled up in to a ball among my dishes and cried myself to sleep, hoping my tears would wash away the dried up Indian curry from a month ago, or loosen the cheese cement attached to my mac n' cheese bowl. Alas, it did nothing. About to give up, I turned to my previous dishwasher-turned-girlfriend and begged for help. After refusing any sort of manual labor plea, we eventually turned to our online friends and discovered the SPT countertop dishwasher. It was a match made in heaven. The SPT easily gobbled up all my dish-related problems and spit out gorgeous, piping-hot, sparkling clean dishes. All I have to do is throw a little dishwasher detergent packet it, click the hose on to the sink, and fire that puppy up. The little SPT box is so whisper quiet, you can practically hear the dishes sigh in relief as they deep soak all the previous months of abuse and neglect away.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Don't get a girlfriend. Get a SPT countertop dishwasher instead."

B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,5,"This ice maker is great! It makes ice really fast. The only drawback is that the ice is a little wet, which is fine if you're using it right away. If you're trying to store up extra in the freezer, you do have to let each basket full of ice freeze completely, break it up, then dump it in a larger container. If you dump each basket right into your larger container you'll wind up with a whole batch of ice that's all frozen together. All you have to do is freeze each seperate basket, break it up, and then dump it with the rest of the ice, and there's no problem."

B00MUVT4MM,Services for You Floating Washing Machine Filter Bags(random Color),Major Appliances,3,"Does a good job of picking up the lint in my Panda washer, but it comes apart very easily.  The main issues I had were the net came off and the floater top kept detaching.  The design of the hinge to for the top is not a good one for something that gets pushed around with force.  I used thin small plastic ties to secure the net to the plastic ring and have not had a problem with it again.  I was concerned that piercing the net with the plastic tie would cause it come apart, but it has been fine.<br /><br />The top was a different story.  I have fixed it 3 time now.  The first two times I used a plastic tie, looping it around to hold the floater 'arm' to the hinge base, but that eventually broke.  This last time I did the plastic tie again, but also used a piece of string, attaching it to the tie and looping it around the hinge base, weaving it in and out like I did the tie.  It has lasted 6 wash loads so far.<br /><br />The picture shows the tie through the 'arm' and hinge before I used the string.<br /><br />Knocking on wood that it holds up several more times before I have to repair again."

B00E8KC36M,"Kitchen Bath Collection STL75-LED Stainless Steel Wall-Mounted Kitchen Range Hood with High-End LED Lights, 30""",Major Appliances,4,"When it arrived, the touch panel didn't work. After requesting a return on Amazon, I was contacted by the company about possibly just checking to make sure the cables were all plugged in for the touch panel.  While the instructions that they sent were clearly for a different model hood (so I disassembled more than I had to trying to follow the directions) I was able to re-seat a few cables and tighten the screws behind the touch panel to get it working again.  Customer service was very helpful and friendly. We found that the LEDs (while very bright) were also VERY yellow-toned.  We replaced them with similar, but not so yellow bulbs that matched a little better with our under cabinet lighting.  Installation was pretty simple as well.  We had to run a vent outside (we had no vent there), so that took quite a bit of time, but once we had it in place, the hood went up very quickly, but did require two sets of hands. The buttons work very well, and are very responsive to touch, and the hood does a pretty good job blowing steam and smells outside. I know some have complained about the noise, but I have to say-- most of the noise comes from the duct work.  Running it straight out of the box with nothing hooked up, it seemed VERY quiet. After we have it hooked up to the outside vent, it's on the loud side, but still quieter than the over-the-range microwave vent that used to be installed in that space.  And it looks great. It's very professional-looking and sleek in person, and makes our builder-basic tiny kitchen look a little less builder-basic. Despite the two small issues we had, we were able to work around them, now that it's installed and the new bulbs are in, we're so happy with the purchase at this pretty incredible price. (Attaching a photo but this one has the new bulbs, not the ones that shipped with the hood.)"

The oven fan on this model (I have it in black) is on the whole time you are baking, and for a long time after you're done.  That would be fine, except it whistles like a gale wind.  So you have to listen to this throughout the preheating cycle, baking/broiling cycle and cool-down cycle.  That adds up to a lot of time.  Another annoyance is that you have to enter the temperature each time you turn on the oven.  My Maytag bake button defaulted to 350 if I would hit it twice.  This oven won't do a thing until you enter the temperature and then hit start.<br />Other than these two problems, I like the stove.  Of course, I've only had it for two days."

I purchased this to replace the HDX model in the fridge. I ran a few gallons through it, then we noticed a day later that our water was yellow and there was buildup in the bottom of a water bottle we had filled. We thought maybe it had been that way since moving in since this was a brand new filter - then I looked in the ice maker where you can clearly see the new ice from this filter is yellow and disgusting. No idea what that yellow is but it absolutely came from this filter, which was new in box and fully sealed. Gross!"

I cannot say that I feel love for them (haha!) but I didn't see any reason not to give them five stars.

B00A798QM8,"KOBE CH2230SQB 720 CFM Stainless Steel Under Cabinet Range Hood from the CH-122 SQB Series, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,3,"The package arrived undamaged; the unit checked out fine.  The unit came with a DVD and an 1 page instruction book.  Why a DVD i cannot explain.  I found the same info online.  The directions however did not mention where to attach the screws, nor were there any screws for mounting.  The knock outs for the mounting screws, ( provide your own, without any mention of it in the literature) did not knock out, but needed to be drilled out.  The collar extension for the 6 in round duct is made from flimsy poly plastic and attached with two screws on a hooking lip.  That was a poor design, as I had to remove the vent hood 2 times, because it separated from the top of the fan twice, while installing the duct work.  Aluminum duct tape was the fix.  ( There is irony here because there is a lot of precautionary mention of fire and sealed duct work in the literature, but they supply a milk jug poly material for the extension collar ! )  There was no template for mounting, I called tech support ( they did answer the phone without too much hold time, a bonus )  We discussed and joked about the lack of info provided, from China.  I was directed to the same video I found online.  From there it was simple.  The unit is light, but two people make install easy, especially when drilling the screws into the cabinet. I used  #10  1 1/2&#34; stainless screws with washers on 2 of the screws.  ( no room on the other 2 screws for washers).  The unit is quite solid and level.  The electrical wires are a bit short, but workable. Tech support advises hardwiring the unit, because of the fact that using a plug could max out the 15 amp service of kitchen GFCI's.  ( Again, more irony, because the power for the hardwiring comes from a 15 amp service from the kitchen GFCI's )  None the less, i opted for the plug in, with no problems.  The unit is fairly quiet.  Again this is subjective, because acoustics are different in each kitchen.  The unit, however does evacuate smoke for most cooking, but VERYPOORLY for the self cleaning feature of the range.  There is a mild increase in draw, as well as an increase in sound,  without the stainless grilles.  The grilles do catch grease, but they are flimsy and easily twist upon removal and insertion.  The  LED lights do a good job illuminating the stove.  We have a black stove with black 20x20 tiles on the black splash, and the added light is helpful.  Opening a window a few inches will help with the necessary make up air needed to ensure maximum air flow.  The controls are hard to see/use, and are not back lit.  To use them, I have  to duck down and look up under the lip of the vent hood. I imagine with time we'll memorize the button functions.  In summary, the unit works, but there are several things which took away from the perceived value of this unit.  Update:  After having this product for a couple of years, It is obvious that the draw is not near the rated CFM.  I personally installed the ducting and calculated the measurements per industry code.  Smoke will plume around the unit when cooking.  Frequently at greasy film is on top of the unit, telling me that it does not work as it should."

B001BVZ66K,Magic Chef 44 Bottle Stainless Dual Zone Wine & Beverage Cooler MCWBC77DZC,Major Appliances,1,"Pros<br />This unit looks great and the handle was a close match for some of my wolf ovens.  I liked the dual zone functionality and the digital readout for the temperature setting and current temp. You can also adjust the height slightly by screwing the feet in our out.<br /><br />It was quiet enough - though not completely silent. A potential concern for me.<br /><br />Can occasionally be found on Home Depot site for $400.<br /><br />Cons<br />I had this unit for about a month. I had 52 degrees on the top and 38 on the bottom. It took about 2 days to reach temperature being full. (During a hot and Humid few weeks in August with no A/C in MA) After about 3 weeks the unit could not hold the temperature on the bottom.  I decided to return it.  After emptying the unit, I noticed a soda can had burst from being frozen. Also the fan was completely frozen in ice. Obviously keeping a low temperature in the bottom in a hot humid climate is problematic.<br /><br />Also - the LED lights never worked.<br /><br />The shelves - do not slide out.  Hard to access the stuff in the back."

B0081LUWTY,KitchenAid Architect Series II KFIS29PBMS 28.6 cu. ft. French Door Refrigerator,Major Appliances,1,"We bought this refrigerator in March of 2014 and there really were very few reviews about it at that time. I was very dismayed to see that Amazon's reviews of this product (with 33 reviewers at the time) granted a wapping 1-star. ONE! Even that is too much. You can't even fit two gallons of milk into either of the containers on the door! Nonetheless, it is an expensive refrigerator from Kitchenaid, so what could go wrong!?!?! Our ice make stopped working a few days ago and now our freezer isn't working. My wife called Kitchenaid twice today and they said that there was nothing they could do, but that she could be an extended warranty for a year for $339 and then they would fix it or that we could go on our own and fix it with another company. TWICE!!! I called and they finally came to grips. I found another user review on Google via Home Depot for this item that really helped me. The parts that fail are actually warrantied for years 2-5. CHECK YOUR WARRANTY .... they will not offer you this info. Here is a copy of it: http://www.kitchenaid.com/digitalassets/KFIS29PBMS/Warranty_EN.pdf. If that is too much work, I have pasted the important stuff below. Here is what you need to know and see though:<br /><br />SECOND THROUGH FIFTH YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY ON CAVITY LINER<br />AND SEALED REFRIGERATION SYSTEM<br />In the second through fifth years from the date of purchase, when this major<br />appliance is installed, operated and maintained according to the instructions<br />attached to or furnished with the product, KitchenAid brand will pay for factory<br />specified replacement parts and repair labor for the following components to correct<br />non-cosmetic defects in materials and workmanship in this part that prevent function<br />of the refrigerator and that existed when this<br /> major appliance was purchased:<br />■ Refrigerator/freezer cavity liner if the part cracks due to defective materials or<br />workmanship.<br />■ Sealed Refrigeration system (includes compressor, evaporator, condenser, dryer<br />and connecting tubing).<br /><br />UNBELIEVABLE!<br /><br />  It kills me to know, however, that I bought a lemon and will have to live with it and replace these parts again every 10-15 months until my 5 year warranty runs out. Believe me, I will not hesitate to use it over and over again until the 5 years are up or they get me another refrigerator that works. Poor quality and cost-cutting on their part is not going to help their bottom line this time! I hope this helps some of you as well. If you still encounter issues, please forward your problem to the office of your state's Attorney General. They eat this stuff up! :)"

Reading the blog, I have never had a brand of microwave failed this often.  I am going to take LG to court.  They have to know there is a major problem, if so many failures, yet they continued producing this worthless piece of junk.  This appears to be another bean counter situation, cheaper to give new machine and fix damage, than recall product."

The dryer broke down after 8 months and required several engineer call outs to diagnose and replace circuit boards and replace them - luckily still under warranty.  Then it broke AGAIN after 18 months, with nothing responsive, same issues as before.  Samsung essentially told us 'tough luck, its out of warranty now'...we called an engineer out to look at it (cost of $95 just to come and assess it)...advised us a seal had gone, causing all the circuit boards to be exposed to moisture and fried.  He advised not to bother repairing it, as it would cost at least $300 just for the parts (let alone the labor), and would almost certainly happen again."
B00SNKU7VQ,Whirlpool W10295370A Compatible Water Filter - Refrigerator,Major Appliances,5,This filter works just a good as the Whirlpool name brand.  I don't see any difference only price is a lot better.  Good service from the company too!  It was easy to install...no different than the ones I have had in the past.  This is the first time I have bought an off brand for my Whirlpool refrigerator and I plan on buying more!
B00SNKU7VQ,Whirlpool W10295370A Compatible Water Filter - Refrigerator,Major Appliances,3,"I received my filter a couple days ago. Although I was hesitant to by a &#34;comparable&#34; filter rather than one from Whirlpool, I liked the price of this one better, and many reviewers gave it a 5-star rating. Mine arrived a few days ago in a timely manner. (I bundled it with other items and got free shipping - I'm not a Prime member). Installed very easily.  Unlike other reviewers, it took my filter over 15 gallons of water flushed through before the grayish carbon color dissipated. I still notice a slight gray tinge when I pour a pitcherful into a white sink. That 15 gallons cost me money and, although I watered my trees with most of it, I didn't appreciate &#34;wasting&#34; that money. I'll still be buying ice for a while because the ice cube mechanisms still have residual carbon bits that haven't flushed out. All-in-all, I'm sure I saved a little, but will try Whirlpool's own brand next time.  ****UPDATE ***** The folks (Jennifer) at Waterfall Filter Co. read my review and contacted me. She assured me that this was an unusually large amount of water to have to flush through the filter - should only be about 1 gallon - and suggested I may have received a faulty one. They sent me a replacement filter right away, at no charge!! The new filter did, in fact, only require 2 pitcherfuls, about 1 gallon, to flush the water through clearly. Good customer service. And, in the end, it is a good product."

BUT, there is one major design flaw! The racks are designed to hold Bordeaux/Cabernet bottles, NOT Burgundy/Pinot/Chardonnay bottles. If you're a Pinotphile like me, you'll need to either remove at least one shelf (I do have a few Bordeaux bottles, which helps) and/or alternate your Pinots face-in/face-out to make them fit.

B00E93Y974,Kegco K309SS-3HB Triple Faucet Digital Homebrew Kegerator - Stainless Steel Door,Major Appliances,5,"I purchased the Kegco K309SS-3 kegerator so I could use it for my home brew and commercial beer.  I had been using a converted refrigerator/kegerator for 5+ years and this is an excellent upgrade.  I have had this since May 2015 and waited before writing the review until I had some time using it.  The ordering process was simple and it’s worth noting that it’s shipped by a trucking company not UPS/FedEx.  It was shipped on a pallet and moved easily through my doorways on a dolly.  It arrived with no damage.  I let it sit overnight before starting assembly.<br /><br />It was easy to assemble and I had a Cornelius keg ready to go from my now old kegerator.  So within a couple of hours I was drinking out of this new kegerator.  What might have made it easy for me to build was having converted a fridge to one before, and having read the instructions while I was waiting for it in transit.  A few weeks later I bought a 1/4 slim keg and put it in with the Cornelius keg, and they fit just fine.<br /><br />It’s in my basement and looks nice, and runs quiet.  The controls are nice and easy to use.  When filling a growler I spilled into the drip tray.  The drip tray and the top of the kegerator are easy to clean.  If not used for a few days the tap does stick a little, causing you to either drink more frequently or just work a little harder for the first beer.  I am impressed with this and would recommend it for any home brewer or beer fan.<br /><br />Rundown of purchase for$ 702.99 + $125 shipping from Beverage Factory<br />KC K3309SS-3<br />Polished Stainless Steel Tower<br />No couplers on original order<br />Double Gauge Regulator with 3 Way Air Distributor<br />I used my existing ball lock coupler and later bought a Kegco Stainless Steel D Coupler (KTS97D-W)"

B004N4MSPO,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"Works great!  Easy to install and set-up (note:  buy some plumber's tape before installing!!!!).  One drawback is the need to (de)attach the hose to the sink before and after every use.  But hey! It's still better than NOT having a dishwasher.  As for interior space, if you have any non-standard sized plates, you will find it challenging to get more than one or two place settings in this dishwasher.  It's sized more for the &#34;entry-level&#34; dish sets sold at Target, Wal-Mart, and the like for people just starting out on their own."
B000ZIRHZS,Bosch : WTMC3521UC Dryer,Major Appliances,5,"I've been using my Bosch dryer for almost five years having bought it from a young couple who purchased it new and lightly used for one year. I've seen quite a few negative reviews on line by people having trouble with the sensors and all I can say is a lot of these are probably installation or user error. It has done nothing but work consistently and perfectly for me, and I use dryer sheets with every load. I use an environmentally friendly dryer sheet (Meyer's Clean Day), not the gunky Bounce type, and have only washed the lint tray twice in five years. I just click it on the Extra Dry cycle and let the sensors do the work - never damp, never wrinkly. Anything that can't be dried that way should be hung or laid flat to dry anyway! My son likes to use the less dry cycles and hang to finish drying. I just check and empty the lint tray before each use, and our venting tube is fairly short so it doesn't get clogged. I've never had a single problem!"
B005GM942C,Panda Small Mini Counter Top Portable Compact Washer Washing Machine 5.5-10lbs,Major Appliances,5,"I am very pleased with the washer... I live in the mountains so I carry my water to the machine and it does a super job if you stick with the weight suggested.  I highly recommend it to the other people up here and the washer would be  great for RV use.  A towel, tshirt, socks and underwear comes out clean as needed...  I do use half the soap and add a strong liquid cleaner.to the wash for good results.  I can even do my twin sheets. Others from the camp have tried it and thewy have all liked the end results.  ."

B0017Y3GGI,"NewAir AI-100R 28-Pound Portable Icemaker, Red",Major Appliances,5,"I started looking for an ice maker in order to supplement the auto-ice maker that's built into our freezer, as it never has seemed to produce enough ice to satisfy my family's needs.  After reading way too many reviews of the reasonably priced portable ice makers, I purchased this one.  My reasons are 1) it was available thru prime within 2 days free shipping . 2) someone wrote the ice was softish and could be chomped/chewed and it is. 3) it arrived right side up because it was marked to do so on the box.  4) the price was right 5) wasn't too excited about the red color, but it looks great on my counter as an accent piece,lol(who knew?).  It seems to be quite the workhorse.  After setting it up, wiping it out, and pouring in the water, it's been making ice non-stop(except to refill).  Everyone whose visited has tried the ice and made a comment about how &#34;awesome&#34; the ice tastes!  I don't know why, as I'm just using tap water in it, but the ice that is produced tastes delicious.  I'm pleased as can be with this purchase and hope we continue to enjoy it for a long time!"

I have used the dryer off and on for a week since it has arrived and now it will not turn on and I have a load of king size wet sheets. I would have gotten my 15 year old Maytag repaired if I thought I was going to get this much trouble from a Speed Queen , the supposed top of the laundry appliance ladder."
B007ZRJQQK,"Whirlpool WFI910H0AS 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Induction Range - Convection",Major Appliances,2,I bought this range in October of 2014. This is the third time I have been in contact with Whirlpool for warranty work for the same issue. I have had a service person out 1 time and they are coming back again today. Whirlpool call center let me know that &#34;this is a warranty for repair&#34; &#34;we only replace if it is deemed unrepairable&#34;<br /><br />Unfortunately each time they claim my range is &#34;fixed&#34; it breaks again. I am sure this is incredibly convenient for Whirlpool since it will be out of warranty next month. It allows them to &#34;repair&#34; my appliance and then say screw you in a month when it is no longer under warranty.  The issue we are having is if we use more than one burner on the cooktop the entire cooktop shuts down. It then beeps every 30 seconds until you go flip the breaker. I read great reviews on this range and I am very disappointed!
B00IR2OX9M,"Samsung DV56H9000GP 9.5 Cu. Ft. Gas Steam Dryer with Drying Rack, Platinum",Major Appliances,1,"Worst dryer ever, lasted 18 months before a faulty roller tore the drum apart.

Never buying Samsung again I am disappointed with their customer service and their product."
B00434YUBO,Whirlpool Duet WFW94HEXW 27 Front-Load Washer 5.0 cu. ft. Capacity - White,Major Appliances,1,"Dear whirlpool, if I could give you half star or none, I would.  The reason for the one star, so I could let people read my warning of how cheated I felt. For the price, it does not match quality.  Remember the saying ' you get what you paid for?' well.... i believe that firmly... until now (-_-) Whirlpool duet is not the cheapest washer, of course, it was marketed as fancy, multiple feature, energy efficient washer and excellent quality.  I like to spend money on quality, however, my standard of quality i guess not the same as whirlpool's standard of quality.  When it works, it works like charm... 3 years and the bearing broke... technician told me just get a new one.  Definitely will not be whirlpool.  Now, the washer stopped working (on, but when started it locks and do nothing else, have to manually unlock the door).  For something that cost over a grand to purchase, I expect the company to upheld their quality to the highest standard, and abandon customer as soon as warranty is off.  yes, i get that s*** happens with prolonged use, preferably more than 5 years, but if there are s*** that could randomly happens with common use, might want to use good parts, good quality control, so you have none of this 'something that randomly happen'.  Thank you whirlpool... you taught me a valuable lesson : sometimes, one can market something as high end product, put fancy make up on it so looks like expensive high quality product,  jacked up price, but quality is no better (maybe a lot worse than) laundromat washer.  Wait.... laundromat washer has to be good quality, since it has to persevere many many many loads..... while whirlpool couldn't even withstand below normal household use (we don't do that much laundry).... if anyone buys whirlpool duet, be prepare of these 'randomly happened s***'."

B008RNPOIU,Indoor Lint Trap Filter,Major Appliances,1,"I purchased about a year ago based on the Reviews I read and boy was I wrong.  This is the WORST indoor vent and makes a complete mess.  The first month it seems great, but by the second month you see how it does not really seal closed and the stuff ends up blowing all over the place.  This is the biggest GIMMICK and not worth even half the advertised price.  The cheap indoor vents that have been around forever actually work much better than this item.  Again it's a Gimmick and it will not preform over any duration of time no matter how much you clean it."

B00CM6J73Q,"Bosch 300 Series SHE53T55UC 24"" 15 Place Setting Built In Recessed Handle Dishwasher With 46 dBA Detergent Tray AquaStop Leak Protection and LED Remaining Time Display in Stainless",Major Appliances,4,"Just got this (model SHE53TF5UC) at one of the big box home improvement stores. I have run three loads through it and it gets the job done. It is also super quiet. The new plastic smell gradually dissipates. Our previous Bosch lasted 6 years. I would have liked to get more out of it (we have hard water) but it was so quiet that we got another one. A word about the connections. It comes with a cord that plugs into the dishwasher at one end and into an included junction box at the other. Your house supply wire easily connects under three screws in the junction box (no wire nuts to mess with). Unfortunately the included junction box does not include a strain relief connector, so reuse the one on the old unit. A very long braided water hose is included and already connected at the dishwasher end, so there should be no leak issues. Ditto the discharge hose. If you're in a drought-afflicted area you'll want to use the Normal cycle, which has the potential to use the least water (2.4 gallons). Why not 5 stars? I just got it and if it continues trouble free I'll update this review."
B003GF77VG,Broan 30W in. QP3 Under Cabinet Range Hood,Major Appliances,4,"Good product - good value. Fan is quiet Except when it is on high - it's a little more noisy than I would like. Design is appealing and controller good. No issues and would purchase again. Only thing that I think is funky is the placement of the screw holes to mount. Very hard to get too, so plan on using a long bit extender. Designed so that you put in the screws and then slide the hood on but that is almost impossible, especially if you want a tight fit. Also doesn't come with a template for mounting which would be nice."

B002W6SN8G,"Electrolux EIFLS55I 4.07 Cubic Foot Front Load Washer with IQ-Touch Controls Featuring Perfect Steam,",Major Appliances,2,"Purchased from Lowes in Oct 2012, luckily I got extended warranty. The pump motor has been replaced 9/13, 1/14, and again 8/15. The repair man knows me now and shared that the pump parts are plastic and easily break with even normal wear. In 1/14 the door latch also needed to be replaced due to the plastic construction.  It works well for a while, then when the pump begins to fail, you are just washing clothes in their own filth because the water isn't completely changed. I've learned when my whites are so white, I have about 3 weeks before it fails completely. Once the warranty is over I will probably add to our overwhelming landfill issues and have to buy something that actually works."

B00NQFSSWS,Samsung Counter Top Microwave,Major Appliances,1,the microwave turntable and light would come by itself and sometimes when you closed the door.  At first we were able to cook with the microwave but eventually it got to where I couldn't get it to cook no matter what we tried such as unplugging it and it would sit there rotating but not heating.  So sadly we had to send it back.  I only got to use the grill feature once and it was fun.

The packaging is inadequate for shipping, as there were a few dents in it, but they are not visible where I placed the freezer, and they did not affect function, so I decided it was not worth sending back. However, they might affect resale value if I ever decide to sell this freezer. The only other problem is not the fault of the product. I placed a small fridge on top of this freezer and I was barely able to get all four feel on the top. I would have liked another inch or two in each dimension, but that isn't the fault of the product. I dinged it one star just because of the dents from the wimpy packaging."

Worked fantastic for 2 years, then the service calls started.  The oven turns off when preheating and will not work until the sensor is replaced.  I've had two new sensors installed in three weeks.  Now that the oven has quit again,  GE says the oven was installed incorrectly, therefore not their problem.  GE claims the cabinet above the unit is too far forward, blocking the exhaust.  Why did it work perfectly for two years?!!!  I'm looking for a replacement oven but will not purchase a GE appliance again."
B008ZEKXZU,Wine Enthusiast Silent 18 Bottle Dual Zone Touchscreen Wine Refrigerator Slimlin,Major Appliances,4,"Quiet, efficient and easy to operate, would have given 5 stars but the flaw (like many other wine coolers) is that it does not hold the larger Pinot or champagne bottles, so you lose a rack just to make space for them. Wish they would make one that accommodates Pinot bottles."
B0075WD1ZC,Koldfront 6 Place Setting Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"I don't understand the bad views about this product. First off, I have never had a dishwasher that DIDNT ask you to rinse the dishes off before putting it in the dishwasher. That is really for your own sake - sure, it makes them easier to clean, but it also keeps it from clogging up the dishwasher. Item came with a chip in the corner but I barely notice it and it doesn't affect the cycle. The only annoying thing is that the dishwasher gel flap does not open mid cycle, so I have to leave it open. Otherwise it is absolutely worth the money I paid for it. Didn't buy it for laziness, just didn't have time to do dishes, so this was a life saver. Fits great on my counter, easy to install, easy to remove the hose attachment when you need the sink (when it's not running of course. What's neat though is that my spray nozzle works while it's running if I need it). It's really an ingenious design. Highly recommended."
B00MVVITWC,Freezer,Major Appliances,5,"I love this little freezer.  I live in a two bedroom apartment and this holds the perfect amount for two adults who like to eat.  The fridge that came with our apartment is smallish and the icemaker in the freezer takes up a great deal of my frozen storage space otherwise.  It works quietly other than a click when the compressor turns on. I had to adjust the temperature to get it right but was amazed that it was down to 0F after just an hour of being plugged in.  This is a popular little freezer because of the price and with Amazon's free delivery, it was well worth the 4-6 week backorder.  Mine was delivered by UPS.  There was minor damage to the very front bottom of the unit but unless you are looking closely it is really not noticeable.  Similar chest freezers are a little more expensive, but delivery in my home town was about $50, so between the delivery and the savings on the price, I feel that this freezer is a very good deal.  I purchased a freezer thermometer from Walmart that hangs nicely from the little basket and the temperature stays consistent."

I had previously replaced just the element but it only lasted a month - most likely one of the thermostats was letting it run too hot.

B003XEUEPQ,Frigidaire 131763202 Door Latch and Switch Assembly for Front Loading Frigidaire & Kenmore Washers,Major Appliances,5,"Last year our Frigidaire front loader washer (model ATF6000FS1) door lock broke and the washer couldn't utilize the spin cycle. We weren't sure if we would have to buy a new washer until we did some troubleshooting and discovered that the door lock was easily replaceable with the correct part. We searched on Amazon, found the part, and two days later, after watching a short YouTube video on the installation, had a good-as-new washer again! It was fairly easy to install after watching the video. I can't tell you how relieved we were to spend a small amount of money in order to have our washer work again. A year and a half later, it is still going strong. If you are having the same problem we had with our washer and this is the part you need, I would highly recommend purchasing it!"

B0055UBB4O,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,4,"My little microwave came in today (super fast shipping at a really good price) and it is exactly what I needed since my old micro was on its final leg (only the express defrost was working). It is a small microwave which helps me save space. It is a perfect size for my home because there are only two of us and we use the microwave for prep work and/or small meals to warm up. It is a light item so it needed to have something placed on top to keep it from sliding a bit when I opened the front door but I had something on my old micro so it isn't a change for me.<br /><br />So far, I warmed up my corn chowder soup from lunch with ease. My son used it to make popcorn. We haven't had micro popcorn in a really long time. The front panel is a bit small so I think people with not great eyesight may want to consider that. If you look at it straight on and in good lighting, it isn't so bad but if it is at an angle with low lighting, the panel labels are a bit hard to discern. That's about the only thing so far that I can say against it. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with it and it was a solid price."

Besides, my kitchen won't smell after stir fry.<br />This model is very similar with Pacair and the price is 1/3. The only thing Pacair claim that their product is slanted so it does better suction!<br />I saw many complain about the LED light. I don't know if my hood is a new version, the light is quite good. It bright enough even with day light.<br />The only thing I am not happy with this product is the button. AKDY trying to make the product look updated with 'sensor' button. So be gentle with these buttons to keep your unit last longer!<br />In general, I'm happy with this unit."
B0046XD52W,NewAir AW-121E 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,4,We love it.... The right compact size for our counter space where our mini bar is. A great price for a mini  cooler that holds 12 bottles!! It was easy to assemble.... Only needed to attach the handle which took only a couple of minutes to install. I would have put 5 stars but the only negative was that it took several hours to get to the right temperature that we choose which was between 56-57 degrees after we first plugged it in.

Beats the hell out of washing dishes by hand anyway. If you have marble counter tops, though, be prepared. You will likely need a $20 side mount bracket (plus S&H), something no one informed of us when we purchased the item. The installer had a top mount bracket (a $10 part not included with purchase) which is secured by glue. He warned us it would fail after 6 months or so ... it lasted four days. I called Frigidaire to get the &#34;accessory&#34; and they acted as though my counter tops were made of unicorn horns and it was entirely my fault. It's odd that a manufacturer would offer a fairly expensive item to customers with the basic means to install it called an &#34;accessory&#34;."

It is the perfect size and because it is stainless steel is allowed in our shop. I love that the freezer is separate from the refrigerator, it seems to be more roomy and I believe will keep the temperatures separate better. We did have to leave it plugged in and running for 24 hours to get a true temperature reading of the refrigerator. When we first plugged it in, the freezer got cold fast but the fridge was making us nervous by not cooling down fast but the next day the temperature was close to freezing so we had to turn it down a little and it now works great!! We would recommend this to anyone!"

No way to know until if and when it happens. But aside from that, this is a good idea, easy to use, and rather cool-looking. The casing is see-through so you can see the circuit board inside, which is kind of fun. I wish this were like some other surge protectors I've purchased where the manufacturer backed them with a warranty for the stuff plugged into it, ie if your computer gets ruined we'll pay for it. That would give me more confidence in it.<br /><br />As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review. I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review. If you don't believe me, click my profile and scroll down to see the poor reviews I've given bad products.

My only complaint about this purchase was the shipping company used. Communication was awful and it took over 2.5 weeks to arrive. They also would not deliver in the house so I had to rent a dolly and nut it into the house which tweaked my back. Still all that was worth the stove.

I got an email at 3:30am from Amazon promoting this one on sale. I didn't have my phone on silent so the notification woke me up. I look at it, liked the specs and was trying to figure out if it would ship to Canada. Only way to know for sure is add it to my cart and take it all the way to the last step before hitting submit order. I found out it did and was planning on sending it to my wife to see what she thought in the morning. So I turn my phone on silent and go back to sleep. Wake up at 7:00 and see an order conf email from Amazon in my inbox. Lucky the specs check out and the Mrs like it.<br /><br />Of all the stuff we've bought for our reno, this was the easiest lol!"
B005KT4LK6,Whirlpool WTW8800YW Cabrio 4.6 Cu. Ft. White Top Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"Called 8/24/15- spoke with representative about our two year old washer.Nothing Whirlpool can or will do.They have no other complaints about rust inside the lid and inside rim at bleach dispenser nor chipping of paint from lid. When asking the Whirlpool representative about the rust, he assured us there were no other complaints.This is hard to believe since our recent research clearly shows that other brands have had to replace tops due to rust. As for clothes not cleaning, no response to this issue. Whirlpool has not trained salespersons and therefore at the mercy of Lowes hard sales tactics and we were very delinquent in researching numerous complaints before purchasing Whirlpool Cabrio Platinum Model WTW8240YWD.Ranked lowest possible from Consumer Affairs with hundreds of complaints.Whirlpool should be ashamed of product, clothes do not come clean, there is no soak cycle, no way to open mid cycle without loosing all water, washer smells horribly, must be cleaned-are you kidding? Who cleans the washer that is supposed to clean clothes with a special cleaner?? We understand safety issues of water in open machine, wonder if Whirlpool understands the need to have a 'soak' feature to clean clothes.  Undereducated buyers like us and the totally undereducated salesperson at Lowes were obviously a horrible combination.It was all about sales for them. No one mentioned and we had no clue that the huge drum would not clean clothes even using less water than a traditional machine. We thought 'platinum' meant a high quality machine.  It clearly was a cleverly used buzz word for sales not a premier cleaning machine.Never, never, never purchasing Whirpool anything again. Wonder if Whirlpool cares, if they read the Consumer Affairs reports, if they respond. Our hard earned money is wasted. Our clothes are dirty, the washer smells, and the top is rusting out!"

I'm happy to report that the new grate fits nicely into the recessed area below the dispenser.  It's a little smaller than the old one but fits and works just fine. Great buy and a simple way to renew the look of your refrigerator.
B00FBJC6NE,SquareTrade 3-Year Large Appliance Protection Plan ($750 - 800),Major Appliances,3,"I purchased a 3-year protection plan from Square Trade for a GE dishwasher. No idea whether the plan will pay up as advertised, because I haven't used it, but I'm not impressed by their &#34;paperless communication&#34; system. In the past, I've always received a printed document specifying what is covered. This time, I received an obscure link in one of several e-mail messages related to the purchase and delivery of the dishwasher.<br />I didn't even spot what it was until I complained that I had not received the warranty I'd paid for. When I did open the link it became clear that I would have had no coverage without sending the company copies of the purchase information. This required several additional steps. I called again when I opened the protection plan and only found information related to cell phones and other electronics. I've been assured that the dishwasher is covered. Guess I'll just have to wait and see."

I had a ton of washing and got it all done in a day, they are clean, bright and fresh.... it brought my whites up lovely!

B008MD2RH6,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,4,"Good price, has continued to work very well since December 2014 (8 months). My only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center. It therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns. I don't see what could cause the loose fit. Nevertheless, the carousel does turn, just not very quietly.<br /><br />Otherwise, great buy. It is still easy to clean. I love using the 1, 2 and 3 settings for one-touch cooking times of 1, 2 or 3 minutes. I really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching &#34;Start&#34; one time. Some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large &#34;open&#34; button is pushed, the entire microwave moves, but I have not had that experience. I seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables, popcorn, potato, etc. I had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn - the microwave didn't sense a need to stop cooking. However, it's fine for baking a potato.<br /><br />I do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior, which contributes to the 1.4 cu ft interior volume. But the size is right for me regardless. Certainly this was the best buy on Amazon for my purposes."
B004ZU09QQ,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,4,"Although it slides when you open the door, this is a great product.

B00XYVEFHG,Electric Mini Portable Compact Washing Machine Wash Cycle 5.5LBS Capacity RV Apartment Home Dorm,Major Appliances,1,It washes well but it doesn't have the spin cycle like the description stated. The input hose is useless.
B00SNKU7VQ,Whirlpool W10295370A Compatible Water Filter - Refrigerator,Major Appliances,1,I have discarded 4 gallons of water and the water tastes terrible.  It tastes like the faucet water--possibly worse.  Very dissappointed.
B002UQ107O,Granite Grabbers Dishwasher Mounting Brackets,Major Appliances,4,"Works good, I had to use Gorilla glue epoxy on one to get it to stay put, however now that both have cured the dishwasher is solidly held in place.  Overall I like the design, would be nice if the small screws had Loctite to keep those from coming loose, its easy to mark the locations on the granite and the remove the strip to fasten the two plates after that simply screw the top mounts to the brackets and you are good to go.  If you make sure the top brackets on your dishwasher are firmly against the plates it will help hold the plates in place to allow for the glue to dry properly and achieve its hold, I had to use a C-Clamp on one of mine since the plate wanted to bend downwards slightly which ruined the included mounting strips hold.  In any case they are not expensive and if the included strip doesn't hold you can use 3rd party epoxy to get the desired result.  I docked one star since I had to use my own glue however these are great and work well for what they are intended."
B00XYVE4B8,ARKSEN Portable Mini Washing Machine 8 - 9LBS Dorm Camping RV Compact Laundry Washer,Major Appliances,5,"Does a really good job washing. Clothes come out nice clean and fresh. Spin dry is not so great, but nothing wringing by hand won't fix. I do several small loads, after about the 6th the machine will stop. Turn off and unplug for a bit and it's good to go again."

B00AMFLZLG,Koldfront Bottle Free Standing Dual Zone Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,3,looks great and works as advertised. Only issue is champagne bottles and longer bottles of wine do not fit. Should have checked to ensure the &#34;bubbles&#34; would fit.
B002HT0958,Mini Portable Countertop Spin Dryer,Major Appliances,5,"I’ve had a few of these through the years – this is my third.  Each one lasted several years.  I found that I really can’t do without.<br /><br />I use this for summer clothes – gauzy dresses or silk items that I don’t want to put in the washing machine, as well as quick wash-ups where I don’t want to go put coins in the laundry machines (I live in a condo with a laundry room).  One of its best uses is for cashmere sweaters and scarves.  I wash them in the sink or tub and a few minutes in this spinner and they are almost dry.<br /><br />Note that it does not produce heat.  It simply spins clothes very, very fast and pulls all the water out.  You can’t squeeze another drop out, no matter how hard you try.  So you can hang clothes up and never have anything dripping.  They will dry super fast on the hanger.<br /><br />The machine has a dial to set the time to spin.  Most items only need two minutes, but it goes up to four.  That is the only setting.<br /><br />Be careful to not overfill the tub.  If you do, a piece can spin up and down the insides.  Not good.  I let that happen once, but I’ll never do it again.<br /><br />Be sure to remove the bottom screws before you use the machine.  It’s got warnings all over it to do that, but I have a relative who ignored the warnings.  The screws are designed to hold moveable parts during shipping and then are to be discarded.  They, of course, prevent moveable parts from moving – not good to leave in place!<br /><br />My only complaint is the very short cord.  You need to have an electrical outlet near a sink or tub where the spinner can be set so it is flat and where the water can drain out.  I live in a very old condo with one electrical outlet in my bathroom.  The cord cannot reach the sink and just barely reaches the tub without an inch to spare."

B0092JSGXI,Panda Portable Compact Cloths Dryer Apartment Size 110v Stainless Steel Drum,Major Appliances,5,"The dryer is used in conjunction with the portable washer Haier HLP21N.<br /><br />My setup is in a downtown condominium where i was unable to install a dryer vent, and unable to run a drain for the washer. This setup is used for 2 active adults.<br /><br />The washer does a great job, not a single complaint.. Look up how to get a quick disconnect system on the water supply line, this will make it much easier to use.<br /><br />The dryer operates beautifully, it is normal dryer amount of noise. The clothes come out dry and smelling great. I would suggest running this to a indoor dryer vent similar to the ones that are normally purchased with this unit and recommended on the main page. The lint filter that is built in does stop most, but a little gets through. i dont want to deal with dusty laundry lint everywhere.<br /><br />i would buy this item again, i would recommend it to a friend. we have been using it for more than 8 months now. Very happy!"

B001I3QQMY,Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Clean Dirty Dishwasher Magnet No 2,Major Appliances,5,Nice full rectangle of magnet on the underside.  Should quite easily stay on the dishwasher door as it's opened and closed. Glossy high quality frontside similar to that of a political button you'd pin to your shirt.  Cute as a button!  It's a keeper.  Thanks for making this product for us Cavalier fans!
B00CDWTQKI,"The Laundry Alternative Nina Soft Spin Dryer, Ventless Portable Electric Dryer. 3 Year Warranty, 127V, 60 Hz",Major Appliances,5,"I love this thing! It really spins out almost all the water. I haven't had any problem with balancing and a trick for removing the Styrofoam bits that are in the drum upon arrival......use a lint roller. Picks up almost every piece stuck to the sides. The only reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is I think I was sent someone's returned device. The metal bar was not attached to the bottom of the dryer and there is a sizeable crack on the top. These however have not affected the function and I see no reason to return it for it to end up in a landfill or resent to someone else. I've tried contacting the seller, but have yet to get a response. I use this in conjunction with a breathing mobile washer and it's a great system for apartment living! **Update** I have since heard from the seller and they have more than made the situation right so I am now therefore pleased to give this 5 stars. Their product AND customer service has exceeded expectations. Today I was able to dry a full sized sheet with no trouble at all and it was sopping wet!"

B002UCYZ0M,Bosch : SHX65P05UC 24 Integra 500 Series Fully Integrated Dishwasher - Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,1,"I've had many dishwashers in my life from cheapo two button Sears to this $1,000+ Bosch. Without a doubt this is the worst cleaning appliance of them all and I'll tell you why.... It does not have a grinder system. Instead Bosch uses an basket filter. What that does is trap food particles that end up washing back on the dishes. A terrible design in my opinion. What we have to do to get a relatively clean washing is to first remove every piece of food from our dishes in the sink. If we don't the food ends up dried on the dishes after the washing and drying cycles are done. Oh, and yes, we clean the filter weekly."

After sometime i have found this machine will keep making ice till it over flows you need to turn if off not always but some of the time, also have found after some use this machine is hard to clean were the ice is made you have to get all the water out of back scoop to prevent problems. It gets a film of some kind i use filter water bottled water would be costly but may prevent issues, really hard to clean back scoop and ice maker."

B007XZ8FNO,LG Over-The-Range Microwave Oven with 300 CFM Venting System,Major Appliances,1,This microwave has every button in the world except a simple timer. We used our microwave timer for everything. It's so stupid that a microwave this expensive doesn't include a basic kitchen timer.

How do I hate thee?  Let me count the ways.<br />1) 3 years info it, there is a horrible smell when it fills, even though I have followed all manufacturer directions for maintenance.<br />2) it has no lint trap, which I suspect adds to the odor problem.<br />3)  it makes more noise than a large empty semi.<br />4) the water mix for warm is actually hot.<br />5) the companion dryer runs VERY hot so I have to dry everything on the delicate cycle.  If I use a different cycle, the clothes come out very hard, like no fabric softener was used."

IT IS FANTASTIC. The ice does expand, after setting, so I always use the small setting and then it makes the ice faster. Just got to remember to turn it on in the morning so there is plenty around noon when needed. It works great for 2 people. It doesn't really keep up for several people."

That little item is not included with this heating element.  The thermostat from your old heating element is still perfectly functional.  The hardest part of replacing this item for me was just moving the dryer away from the wall.  The part replacement itself was relatively simple.<br /><br />Run the dryer once on high temperature to ensure it's working before you put the whole thing back together, and also to &#34;burn in&#34; the element.  Sometimes the first time or two can produce a smell.  You don't want your clothes to inherit that smell.  I took a picture of the heating element as I ran my burn-in cycle."

It does make ice pretty fast. Can keep up with a crowd. The large ice is not really that large, I do notice that they melt faster than solid ice.

B007RWOUSM,"GE GTW485ASJWS Energy Star 4.2 Cu.Ft. Top Load Washing Machine with 16 Cycles, White",Major Appliances,1,"Bought a maytag toploader from Lowes about 1-2 years ago. When I received this machine, I followed all directions on loading clothes and amount of He Detergent to use.  Put the machine on Normal Wash and found out after several loads of wash that some of the clothes were not even getting wet.  Set the machine on &#34;Power Wash&#34; and have been using this setting ever since to at least get my clothes wet and relatively clean. When I say relatively, that is exactly what I mean. My trousers still come out with white streaks that do not come out in the dryer. The technology that is being used by Maytag and other topload washers - being no agitator- simply does not work.  The amount of water used to wash the machine is extremely limited and I would really recommend anyone wishing to buy a toploader read this.  I will be purchasing a front loader, which by the way, uses less water, less power, and  DOES cleans your clothes in less than 1 1/2 hours.  No kidding, the &#34;Power Wash&#34; cycle takes 89 minutes - Ludicrous!  Until this industry substantially changes this technology, I would strongly recommend that no one purchase a top loader - it's a waste of your money.  I know because now I have to again purchase another machine and it won't be a MAYTAG!!"

B00D1SZNO6,"Avanti RA7316PST 2-Door Apartment Size Refrigerator, Black with Platinum Finish",Major Appliances,4,"Arrived really well packaged, and in pristine condition. Works Well. Good Door seal. Its worth noting that mine arrived with 4 door shelves that covered the width of the door and not the small shelves pictured. All of the shelves are removable and the third shelf down has a slightly lower repositioning option if desired. It is NOT AUTO DEFROST. And has a somewhat quirky characteristic of forming frost on the inside rear wall of the refrigerator section, when the compressor is on, this then melts and is channeled away down a small hole when the compressor is off. Called a Cycle Defrost. The freezer section will require a manual defrost too. All in all the Avanti is good package for the $349 i paid for it at time of purchase. I see now that it is listed at $454 currently. I would, frankly, have been far less happy at this price point as I feel the overall build quality, while far from being poor, does not warrant a cost in excess of my original purchase cost.<br /><br />Its has not yet been running 24hts, and is already very cold. If the energy star rating is accurate, it is a great little energy efficient unit.<br />Didn't get 5 stars from me because I would have preferred a little bit more freezer, even at the expense of a little bit less fridge<br /><br />At 7.4 Cubic its OK. A 9.9 Cubic is a more realistic size IMHO. But for what it is, and how it does it. It seems to be an excellent little unit."

B0055UBB4O,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,5,"I don't  normally  write  product reviews,  But I'm  so. Pleased  with this microwave, I  had to share my experience. As the headline says, I'm a OTR I  trucker and own a Peterbilt  389 conventional. This microwave  fits in my space perfectly, I could not fit the next size  up (.9  cu  ft) in there. It's  been bouncing around in this truck for a couple of months now and no sign of coming apart! To open/close  the door you just grab the handle, no button to push. To nuke  something  for 30 seconds, just press the start button and that's  it! To nuke  something for 1 or 2 or 3 or 5, etc. minutes just press that button and it starts nuking without having to press the start button! Also, when the microwave  is  nuking your  stuff, the inside light stays on so your can see how everything  is going!  I love this microwave. Now you gotta keep in mind, this is only a 700 watt machine, so your. cooking times are a little longer. But if you can only fit this size machine  into the space you have, you can't  beat  this microwave .  The price is very competitive  also."

B00KXE3OKG,Lg Power Pair- Ultra Large Capacity Top Load High Efficiency Laundry System with Matching Gas Dryer(wt4870cw+dlg4871w),Major Appliances,1,"This is regarding the washer only WT487OC*:<br /><br />We bought the unit 2 years ago when moving into a new house. Right away there were problems with getting a UE error code and the device stopping in the middle of a load or requiring restarting the cycle. We assumed this was due to our fault with how we &#34;balanced&#34; the clothes according to the manual as this is what it said when we looked up the error code in the book-- this was our first HE washer so we didn't know what was normal. Subsequently we bought my parents a similar model and they've *never* had a UE problem. I researched online and found this to be a known issue, see consumer reports article http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/02/putting-an-end-to-an-endless-washing-machine-cycle/index.htm<br /><br />After going through the trouble-shooting process with with the reps online (three calls now) it was determined that the machine does have a problem and I need a service rep to come out -- of course I am out of warranty period now, even though sticker on machine says 10 year warranty on motor.<br /><br />Obviously not too happy with this purchase and the fact that the instructions and manual lead you believe the UE problem is due to something the consumer is doing wrong, hence our delay in investigating further until we realized this is not normal.<br /><br />Not happy about this, I advise anyone reading this to purchase a top-loader other than LG. Again on consumer reports you will see that among top-loaders they have the highest repair rate (23%!)"

B00DLPAQSW,HOMEIMAGE DUAL-ZONE Thermo Electric Wine Cooler for 18 Bottles - HI-18T,Major Appliances,1,"This cooler worked well for about a month. It held the temperature well IF the cooler was completely full. Over time it started to stray a few degrees from the set temperature, especially the upper portion, progressively getting worse. The unit also started getting noisier which should have been a tell-tale sign it was about to quit on us.<br /><br />Right about at the 1-year of ownership mark we came home and saw the external temperature reading for the top section indicating 93 degrees! I immediately opened it up and it was blowing hot air all over our wine bottles. I would've expected the thing to just plain give up, but really didn't expect it to turn in to a heater!<br /><br />I am not sure if this is a function of thermo-electric coolers in general, but every single one of them seems to last about a year and quit on you. I was hoping with the relatively high reviews on this one that it would be different, but you get what you pay for. Stay away from this one unless you want to buy a new fridge every few months.<br /><br />To HOMEIMAGE, wouldn't cost too much to have a shut-off when the unit goes a few degrees above room temperature. Would certainly save your customers a lot of money and trauma while your product ruins sometimes irreplaceable bottles."

Capacity Steam Washer/Dryer Combination with TurboWash, TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System, NeveRust Stainless Steel Drum, Allergiene Cycle in White",Major Appliances,5,"i had the issue of clothes being very wet after the dry cycle. I found that it all has to do with the water evacuation hose position. The hose MUST point downward and never turn upwards. The drying system requires all water to be pumped out so it can dry properly. If not, the water remains in the system and it can not dry the clothes. I could not reuse the pipe that my previous washer used as it was too high and forced the hose to point up. I had to run the hose down to a drain in the floor. Once I did this, all items, including heavy towels and jeans came out totally dry once done. I have a feeling lol those reviews claiming wet clothes are not draining water correctly and thus giving their review an unfair low rating. You can't rate an appliance low for not setting it up correctly."

B00N9DLM1Q,"LG LFXS30766S 36"" French Door Refrigerator with 30 Cu. Ft. Capacity in Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,4,"We recently replaced our Samsung, which in the 4 years since we bought it, had broken for the third time. We chose this LG which we have been happy with and there are a few features which make it really unique. We are a soccer family; coach, ref and both of our girls play, so we go through a LOT of ice. This fridge has two ice makers AND the ice cubes are smaller so when you are holding a sports water bottle up to the ice shute, the ice falls right in where old sized ice used to get stuck in the opening. It makes ice fast and the water is nice and cold which really helps. The rest of the features on the fridge are great too. The door-in-door works as expected although you have to make sure it is shut or else it will pop open. In addition, I would swear that our veggies and fruits are staying fresher longer. The space is organized well too. If I had one complaint it would be the location of the water spout. If you look closely at the picture, you would assume it comes out at the same location as the ice like most fridges but it doesn't; it comes out in the space above it which means it is above the eye level of smaller kids (say age 9 on down) and also is confusing to guests. Everyone who comes in the house uses their hand to push the water button with the cup in the ice area and it shoots water out down the front of them. It's kinda funny in a way but then there's the clean up to consider and people feel badly for making a mess which of course is silly but it is what it is. I have taken to giving people a run down of the fridge when they come for the first time and that works but is a bit of an inconvenience, especially if I forget. I don't know yet about the longevity of the fridge but if it is anything like the trouble free 10 years we have gotten out of our LG washer/dryer then I think we will be happy. The water also tastes really nice too. Very clean, like Ozarka."

B00B46P5R2,LG LFX25991ST 24.5 Cu. Ft. Counter-Depth French Door Refrigerator with Smart Cooling Plus,Major Appliances,2,"Only a few positives to mention, LG did send a technician out the following day. Within 30 minutes he was able to determine that the main control board was sending voltage to the blower fans but the fridge fan wasn't working. I'm now on day 10 waiting for a fan motor. The freezer still works but we had to toss out everything from the fridge compartment due to a non-op fan & 50+ degree temps. I'm told that LG ships parts ground so if they're in stock it's usually a 3-5 day wait. If the part is on back order I'm expecting an additional 2-3 week wait.<br /><br />My wife and I really liked this model, particularly being the largest capacity counter depth we could find. Unfortunately at only 11 months into ownership we're experiencing a breakdown. Good thing we purchased the extended warranty, based on the other reviews here, looks like I'll need it. I should also mention the error code displaying &#34;Er - rF&#34;... it disables both the water and ice dispenser. My other disappointment, although minor, LG rejected my review of the LFX25991ST, no reason provided."

Standard 12&#34; plates are too tall for the drawers. When closing the drawer, 12&#34; plates scrape the top of the door opening.<br />2. Having the rotating sprayer on the bottom of the drawer means any object (spoon, jar lid, etc.) that drops down stops the sprayer from spinning and the dishes from getting clean. When the drawer is full, it is difficult to see if something has fallen to the floor of the drawer. Result: many unclean loads that aren't discovered until you start to unload the drawer.<br />3. The drawers don't drain consistently. The drain is a very small opening that chunks of food will clog up. Like a popcorn kernel. Yes, there's a filter screen and I don't know how the particles of food get past it but they do somehow. The drain is hard to locate and reach and is difficult to clean out. Result: lots of undrained water sloshing around in the bottom of the drawer.<br /><br />We've owned this appliance for less than a year and have already had three service calls for repairs."

Then went through ebates for an extra 2% savings and at checkout used my Target Red card for the extra 1 dollar owed and got another %5 off. Anyway wanted to share some savings you may be able to use. So overall on top off the %15 ($34 savings) off right now I also saved 24 dollars with a 200 gift card that cost me 190 ($10), ebates ($4)and RED card ($10).

B005BHSY6Y,"Whirlpool WDT790SAYM Gold 24"" Stainless Steel Fully Integrated Dishwasher - Energy Star",Major Appliances,1,"This dish washer is a piece of junk! I've had mine for about two years and it probably hasn't been ran more than a 2-3 dozen times.  It's never cleaned the dishes properly - the top rack items are just as dirty as they were before washing them.  I've tried the different settings, making sure the filter is clean, etc.  Makes no difference.  This unit replaced a nearly 20 year old Kitchenaid that worked well but looked bad when I was doing a kitchen remodel - I supposed I'm going to just buy something else because a repairman wouldn't be much cheaper than something new...  I'm going back to Kitchenaid!"

Embarrassing engineering. Before buying, I suggest you put some dishes in the lower rack and open and close it a few times. Voila,  the rack comes off the track with regularity.  And the rollers flip off easily onto the floor or into the dishwasher tub as the rack falls onto the door.  It's a double whammy. . We knew the rack pins could have been more receptive to items of various shapes, but we could live with that as well as  the monthly additive and energy efficient drying. But, I am surprised by the basic and blatant design glitch of the rack and rollers. Of course, there are multiple simple fixes, but not in this unit.  As we look to re-do our kitchen, we will certainly not be looking at any Bosch products."

Four years later, and the machine, which was horrible in all the ways outlined by other users below, is beyond repair.  Tomorrow morning I am going back to my appliance store and buying a simple washer with an agitator and water levels that I control.  I think Speed Queen makes one that fits the bill.  I have read hundreds of negative reviews of this machine, and will NEVER buy a Maytag appliance again.  4 years, REALLY, and according to some reviews, I'm lucky it lasted that long."

No parts are missing, which is also a plus for me.  I read instructions, hooked up to faucet, then dishwasher, crossing my fingers there would be no leaks.  I loaded dishwasher, put in my tablet and rinsing aid and turned on.  No leaks!  Not noisy at all!  Unfortunately, my counters at not very deep, so I have a cart that I had on standby, just in case.  Not a problem at all.  I did as others mention, putting the drain water to run out into the sink over other dirty dishes in a pan.  I used the pot setting since dishes were sitting in the sink for several hours before I had time to actually connect the dishwasher.  Dishes are washing right now, so I will update later about how clean it came out."
B00PGFGVB6,EasyGoDryer - Portable Electric Air Drying Clothes Dryer,Major Appliances,3,"First of, this is a portable clothes drying machine. I can tell you, that yes, it does dry clothes. I bought this for drying my daughters cloth diapers and for trying it out in regards to Tiny House's and Tiny House living. If you want this for a small area, I don't recommend it unless you have a really good air filtration system. Why? Because it makes the room it's in very humid and for a Tiny House, humidity can be your worst enemy. That being said it would probably be fine if you put it in the bathroom and turned a good bathroom fan on.<br /> I put 5 or 6 prefold diapers that were hand rung, so still pretty soaked, into the tent and it took 4 hours to mostly dry them. So it works. It's like a quick version of hanging over night. They aren't fluffy like when they are in a tumble dryer. Minerals in the water set and made my diapers a bit stiff, but if you have a spin dryer or a spin cycle with your washer this type of mineral setting isn't such a problem. I imagine drying would be quicker and maybe even less humid. But if you are using a portable hand washer, you'll have to keep what I've said in mind while using this product.<br /><br />The reason I said it's sketchy is because when you turn the timer on, it sparks. Like a pilot light in a propane stove. SPARK* it makes me nervous. Also it looks like some college kid jerry rigged a hair dryer into a kids play tent and was like, this will work! and it does. but still seems like it could be a hazard if you aren't careful with it.<br /><br />I did like that you could fold up the tent into a small bag. It came with 2 clipped hangers with multiple clips on each wrack. I didn't like that the metal hang lines down't fold up into the bag or box without unscrewing them.<br /><br />If you are unsure about buying this product, I'll be posting a more complete review on my blog, www.tinyakadventure.com"

I researched kegerators a LOT, and unless you are going to drop big bucks to buy commercial, this is THE ONE to buy!  If all you want to do is put a keg of Bud Light on tap for the Sunday games, go ahead and buy a single tap Danby from Costco.  If you are serious about beer, brew beer or know brewers, and want to be able to offer your guests an assortment of high quality beer out of corny kegs or sixtles, spend the money to buy THIS kegerator, and spend the money to upgrade the tower and faucets or stainless steel Perlicks.  You might hate the hit your checkbook takes, but you will NEVER be disappointed with the product.  Instructions for assembly are a tad lacking, but following your instincts and common sense will get you through.  Once set up, you can look forward to tapping up to three 5-gallon kegs at once, letting you offer an assortment of craft beer, home brew, cider, mead and soda.  Or, if you are dehydrated, go ahead an buy a keg of Coors Light... you can always put in one full-size keg.<br /><br />For those of you wondering, yes, you can fir the CO2 tank and three 5-gallon kegs in at the same time.. even if you upgrade to the dual gauge regulator and distribution block.<br /><br />This is a great kegerator. You won't be disappointed.  CHEERS!"

I should say here that I have an overly sensitive nose and smells that are offensive REALLY offend me.  My dishwasher came in the door with an interior odor before even being installed.  It was not an offensive odor but &#34;something&#34; that I had not experienced before.  After several washings it as dissipated a little.  For the time being I am going to give Bosch a break because the odor has more of an industrial scent than anything else.  I do know that high quality rubber does smell and that may be the culprit.  Since it doesn't smell up my kitchen and the only time I smell it is when I stick my head in the machine, I'm not going to worry about it for now unless it gets worse.  I'm also following the advice of other reviewers who suggest putting a towel in the door opening to keep it ajar.  Hope this helps."

B00AW04ZMM,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine 7.9-15lbs with Spin Cycle …,Major Appliances,5,"I researched and read everything I could on small washers that I could use in my loft.  The reviews pinpointed the Panda (not the Blue Panda) and the Haier.  I finally decided on the Panda as the reviews appealed to me the most.  It is now the 2 weekend of washing and I have a system that works very well.  No more trudging to the laundry room.  My loft has an upstairs balconied area where I can hang the sheets and jeans to dry, the shirts I put on hangers and line on the shower rod, the little stuff are draped on towel rack.  The spinner takes out so much water, that all the wash dries very quickly (within 3 hours) save t-shirts that can take overnight.  I may have to figure out what to do when winter strikes and the balcony area is no longer so warm.  That's another round of research."

I have two Taylor Digital Thermometers[[ASIN:B00875TVYQ Taylor Digital Refrigerator Freezer Thermometer]]: 1x hanging from the steel-wire rack, center fridge and the other in the 'freezer' compartment. These thermometers record lowest, highest and current temps. The thermometer in the refrigerator reads a low of 45f, with infrequent door openings (only about twice a day). The freezer, maybe a couple of degrees lower.<br /><br />Maybe it's because my (non-air-conditioned) apartment is bout 75-80 degrees? Or maybe my expectations were too high? Maybe smaller refrigerators generally don't perform as well as their larger brethren (however, the technology is the same, hasn't changed much since inception and you'd think a smaller container would be easier to chill than a larger).<br /><br />If you're just planning on using it to chill drinks, it should be fine. Perishables? I wouldn't chance it.<br /><br />On the plus side, it is relatively quiet and ground shipping from Atlanta to Chicago (non-Prime) only took 2-days,"

B00GXHRC6E,LG H/E Super Capacity H/E Top Load Laundry Pair with Powerful StainCare Technology WT4870CW DLE4870W (ELECTRIC Dryer),Major Appliances,1,"This is regarding the washer only:<br /><br />We bought the unit 2 years ago when moving into a new house.  Right away there were problems with getting a UE error code and the device stopping in the middle of a load or requiring restarting the cycle.  We assumed this was due to our fault with how we &#34;balanced&#34; the clothes according to the manual as this is what it said when we looked up the error code in the book-- this was our first HE washer so we didn't know what was normal.  Subsequently we bought my parents a similar model and they've *never* had a UE problem.  I researched online and found this to be a known issue, see consumer reports article http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/02/putting-an-end-to-an-endless-washing-machine-cycle/index.htm<br /><br />After going through the trouble-shooting process with with the reps online (three calls now) it was determined that the machine does have a problem and I need a service rep to come out -- of course I am out of warranty period now, even though sticker on machine says 10 year warranty on motor.<br /><br />Obviously not too happy with this purchase and the fact that the instructions and manual lead you believe the UE problem is due to something the consumer is doing wrong, hence our delay in investigating further until we realized this is not normal.<br /><br />Not happy about this, I advise anyone reading this to purchase a top-loader other than LG.  Again on consumer reports you will see that among top-loaders they have the highest repair rate (23%!)"

Great low profile (much lower profile than previous one) that looks much nicer. Also compliments the Bosch oven and dishwasher (that both replaced Maytag appliances two years ago in our custom home.) Deep basin to collect any pot overflows.  It came with a gasket to prevent any counter spills from dripping into drawers below. Plenty of space to cook and puts out LOTS of heat. It came with the LP conversion kit. Simple directions and easy to install. Biggest challenge was widening cut out in granite counter and cutting down drawers below (I hired those jobs out.)

B003UR2D8W,Danby Silhouette French Door Design 60 Can/27 Bottle Beverage Center,Major Appliances,1,"Bought this Danby unit in Canada for approx $1200.00, great looking unit and does a good job of cooling.  The first unit failed in about 9 months due to a clunking compressor, it was so loud it would wake us up at night.  The entire unit was replaced on warranty, the second unit had the same failure about 6 months in.  We are now on our third unit with the &#34;new upgraded compressor&#34;, it is worse than the first two.  Our appliance store has no options for us, there is no other unit that is side by side two doors, other domestic manufactured models have 1 large single door that would block the walkway when open.  I would not recommend Danby products as the are obviously using junk refrigeration compressors. High price, dubious quality."

FYI I put the ice in a double plastic grocery bag & when I need ice I slam the bag on the cement ground to break it up."
B00EJPHJVK,Fantech Lint Trap for Dryer Booster - DBLT4W (White),Major Appliances,4,"I constructed a new longer dryer vent path out to the front of the house, so I needed a [[ASIN:B000GXF7KO new inline fan]] for that extra oomph. As I didn't want lint clogging the fan, or cluttering up my front yard, I purchased this lint trap. I had seen it used on the TV show Holmes Inspection (available on Netflix) and thought it a great idea. My previous system of venting into an external water trap in my 3 season porch had resulted in an horrible accumulation of lint all over the place, not to mention the fire hazard of flexible ductwork filled with lint.<br /><br />So, I'm happy to report that this does a very good job of stopping lint from progressing through my ductwork. After 5 months enough lint has reached the outside vent fill my hand (not much).<br /><br />To get it offset from the wall, and give room for the fan which I placed immediately above it, I mounted this on doubled blocks of 2x6 that I rounded off a bit and painted white before attaching with deck screws to my wall. Then I put screws right through the corners of this trap. It isn't going anywhere. I had a bit of trouble getting a decent seal to the 4 inch flexible ducting from my dryer, and it does whistle a tiny bit, but it looks OK and is functional.<br /><br />My one real issue (and I don't know if this is solvable) is that to clean the trap, I have to jerk the cover out of the box, and this action invariably brings a spray of dryer debris (little bits of hardened paper, etc.) which I have to wipe off my washer--which is immediately below this trap. As others have pointed out, the cover does not fit quite square in the box, but this might just be to allow the cover to come out at all. It doesn't appear to leak hot moist air into the room, which would be an actual problem.<br /><br />I'm quite happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone willing to listen to my epic story of installing a 30 foot dryer vent."

B004MX8XO6,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"I bought this for my niece. She is living in a cabin that does not have a kitchen sink and she wanted a way to do her dishes without using the bathroom sink. She loves it and it works great.  It was super easy to attach to the bathroom faucet. It does a great job. It fills from sink faucet and drains into the sink.  She has it sitting on an old sewing machine cabinet temporarily.  It stays right next to the bathroom sink without taking up a lot of space.  If I had limited space and living in a place with a limited kitchen I would not hesitate to buy this dishwasher.  It does a great cleaning job.  You can actually get a fairly large load of dishes in it.  Even though I bought an adapter I didn't need it because everything needed came with the machine.

B00KCTTSP2,Frigidaire FGMV175QF 1.7 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Microwave Oven,Major Appliances,1,"This Microwave is part of a line of completely worthless and pathetic appliances. Disposable microwave. We bought the micro, ref, and gas range...the dishwasher had a 1 1/2 star rating that we noticed after we first bought all four units. We canceled the dishwasher but foolishly and EXPENSIVELY purchased the remaining three. The service people were called out three times with nothing but excuses and fixes that lasted a few weeks to a couple weeks. We figured we were moving in a year so we didn't bother wasting more of our time. Their &#34;windows&#34; of service where ridiculous and forced us to end up taking four days off work for three visits. Why four...because one of the days they were supposed to be here between 10 and 2.......their technician called in sick which we didn't find out until 3:30 when they finally returned out call from 2:00 on the dot.<br /><br />This microwave looks great...the features seem decent enough. The problem is that the door latch broke loose inside the door which cannot be serviced...only replaced...the lowest bid from two local repair companies.....$260 bucks...this piece of garbage sells NEW on Amazon for $299.99.<br /><br />We considered buying it again because it matches the other appliances (ALL have major problems that either cant be fixed or cost nearly as much as a new unit) but here is no way I can let myself screw over the next owners as we have our house listed for sale. We are spending $125 more on a microwave that has a proven record...unfortunately it is also from the Electrolux Corporation that makes SOOOO many brands of appliances.<br /><br />I remodel kitchens for a living and I steer ALL clients away from the Frigidaire Gallery line of appliances. The problem with today's appliances isn't unique to low, middle or high end appliances. As far as service after the sale..they all suck. Don't buy &#34;newer&#34; models until folks have had time to review then after YEARS of use. I have a kitchen I did for a couple that spent nearly $25,000 on their Jenn-Air ovens, stove, refrigerator, dishwashers, and under counter ice machine. Every single one has had the repair guy out at least once...the two double ovens they bought...SEVEN visits, THREE control boards and underwhelming performance forced this couple to upgrade their entire kitchen to Viking.....not sure how much but probably in the realm of $40,000.<br /><br />My washing machine went out and I was looking at spending $1,200 until I looked at Consumer Reports...they rated mine high...but they rated a $350 top load machine higher...how could this be?

I have this microwave(now broken) and instead just buying the same one and pushing it onto the next owners of my house, I will spend $125 more so they don't have the same POS to deal with in two years. I will have to drill new mounting holes and install a new hanging plate on the back of the wall to boot!

B007TTR4GI,Speed Queen 3.3 Cu. Ft. White Top Load Washer - AWN432,Major Appliances,5,"Manufacturer's should watch and learn from this company:  Quality is wonderful.<br /><br />In my adult life, I have owned two washing machines.  The first was a Maytag I purchased in the 1980's that I got rid of to upgrade to a new HE unit.  The replacement (the second I owned) was awful.  I didn't keep it for a month before it was sent back.<br /><br />Because the second unit was such a lemon, I asked the internet what it thought the best washing machine on the market was.  A poster on a forum I frequent pointed me to the Speed Queen.  In my travels, I have often needed to use commercial machines at laundromats. Without fail, they stock the Speed Queen.  After digging deep onto various forums regarding the machines, I was sold.  I have had my SQ unit for a week.  It runs perfect.  It cycles in under 30 minutes, spins clothes dry (unlike the #2 unit I ditched), and cleans them.  The added option of being able to add more water is a plus, but not one that I use.  Thank you Speed Queen and to the guy that sold me my third washing machine I have ever owned (only because the 2nd one was so bad).  I have faith that the unit will last me 25+ years like my previous Maytag did."

B00JJUDKBS,Haier Portable Washer Caster Rollers wheels 5sets (1 extra bonus)- Hlp21n/hlp23e/hlp21e,Major Appliances,5,"So I have not had any of the issues others have reported. The only things I can think of is others have either:<br /><br />A: neglected to &#34;unlock&#34; the wheels to the rolling position after arrival. (All wheels come &#34;locked&#34; you need to lift the lever on each one before installing to get them to roll).<br /><br />Or<br /><br />B: they are rolling the washer long distances, over multiple types of floors, and putting too much pressure on the machine while doing this.<br /><br />By no means are these industrial strength but, I installed on my machine (I have one of the larger capacity ones and is heavier than the standard) and have rolled back and forth from my dining room to kitchen (about 5 or 6 feet, transitioning from hardwood to kitchen tile) probably about 10-15 times so far and have had no issues whatsoever. Nothing has broke and at no time is the machine ever unsteady. I do take my time rolling with minimal pressure and make sure to lift very slightly from the transitions between rooms. Again, no issues, machine doesn't rock or move at all during washing, and at no time has anything seemed on the verge of breaking.<br /><br />If neither A or B applies to those who have broken wheels, well then my opinion is you may have just gotten a bad bunch. As long as you're realistic on how much pressure and distance these wheels can take (and you have them set in &#34;unlock&#34; to roll) I foresee no issues with these. It is a much better option than the standard &#34;feet&#34; my machine came with that had me lifting and almost dragging this beast to the kitchen sink multiple times a week."

The first one wouldn't even power up.<br />After the replacement arrived, it came with a big dent in the back.<br />I'd get another replacement, but it's a hassle dealing with a bulky item like this. I'll monitor for a month and if there are any problems with the functionality of the replacement unit, I'll request a replacement."

Make sure you out a bowl in front of it to catch the water.  , it spilled out over the RV floor and i used a pan.

B00ZPL5CCA,Useful UH-CW160 Automatic Electric Small Mini Portable Compact Washer Washing Machine 8.5 LB Capacity,Major Appliances,5,"This washer is excellent. It has both normal and gentle agitation. The drain hose lowers to empty wash, rinse, and extraction water.  Excess water is removed from laundry by lowering the drain hose and selecting either &#34;normal&#34; or &#34;gentle&#34; agitation. The agitator will wring wet laundry by twisting it clockwise and counterclockwise. Once the tub is empty of either wash or rinse water, select &#34;drain&#34; for 5-6 minutes by the timer.  This is an excellent semi-automatic washer. Instead of spinning a basket, the Useful washer employs its oscillating agitator to &#34;twist&#34; soaked laundry. This simulates hand wringing. Importantly, the oscillating action prevents laundry balling or roping as occurs with clockwise only rotation. Individual pieces of laundry can be removed after &#34;twist and drain&#34;.  This is one of the better class of washers. The oscillating agitator not only washes and rinses, but wrings as well.  To conclude, if the oscillating control switch were labeled &#34;wash and wring&#34;, this would probably help. The real problem is that the instructions for this machine state, &#34; (4...drain the water by laying down the drain hose. Twist the laundry...) As with the control switch, there is a very subtle lack of information about the agitator spin wringing. However, there are 3 identical characters on the impeller or agitator that resemble the Easy Washing Machine Co. trademark. Easy marketed the vacuum washing machine. The vacuum bells washed, rinsed, and extracted laundry in the tub of water.  The more complicated washers employ some type of rotary spinning device to extract more water than the agitator wringing method widely possible. However, the superior &#34;twisting&#34; water extraction of the Useful washer prepares damp laundry for either line or machine drying.  I highly recommend JMilesCO.com for professionally qualified sale of the Useful washer. 5 stars across the board --way to go!ross the board --way to go!"

B00AW04ZMM,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine 7.9-15lbs with Spin Cycle …,Major Appliances,5,"Just so you know: I rate things for what they are, not for what they could never be. For instance, this gets 5 stars as a portable washer when no hook up is available not as a replacement for a top of the line hook up washer.  I have been using my Panda Washing Machine with Spin Dryer for 2 months now. It has been wonderful for me living in an apartment with no washer/dryer hook up. When it first arrived I was worried b/c the delivery service had left it upside down in the rain outside of my covered front porch. As soon as I saw it, I brought it in and dried it off as much as possible. I immediately contacted Panda, and they handled my concerns with professionalism and care. It turned out that my drying efforts were sufficient and the machine is operating without hiccups 2 months later, but I still appreciate the customer service I received in the face of my concerns.  Here are some things I have done to get the most out of my washer: 1) I'm using 2 additional filters, 1 floating one that I've tied to the side and one that I've attached to the end of the drain hose. 2) I put it on a coffee table so that when it drains I don't get water stuck in the hose. 3) I use my extendable shower head to fill the washer rather than the hose provided because you have to hold the hose provided the entire time it's filling if you're using hot water. 4) Do not use garment bags. This machine is rough and will tear your delicates and garment bags. I've been using cheese cloth bags with the strings tucked inside and those have been holding up much better. Hope you guys enjoy yours too!"

Well it runs constantly.  When it gets to the set temperature it will shut off for maybe a minute or two and then its back running again.  We made sure the ambient temperature in the house met the standards outlined in the manual, along with ensuring the cooler was level and had the appropriate clearances.  Finally we contacted the company and to quote their response &#34;Thank you for contacting NewAir. It is completely normal for the unit to run all the time to keep the wine bottles cool. The unit runs on fans, so in order to maintain temperature the fans need to be running. Please let me know if have any other questions or concerns.&#34;  We contacted them again to clarify they meant it should run 24/7 and the reply was &#34;Yes, the fans will be running constantly.&#34;  Personally we don't think it's appropriate for a cooler to run constantly especially when it has reached the set temperature.  Our refrigerator doesn't do that!  If you don't care that an appliance runs 24/7 then this would probably be a good buy for you.  We, however, are very disappointed in our purchase.<br /><br />One other note - the user manual that comes with the cooler states clearances of 1&#34; all around.  The NewAir website states 5&#34; clearances are needed.  The user manual included states ambient temperatures of around 75-80.  The user manual you can download from the website states 50-80.  Someone at NewAir should review their user manuals and get them in sync."

B002UYSHMM,Haier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer,Major Appliances,5,"This is great, quiet machine that washes relatively quick and offers lots of easy-to-use user options for how you want your clothing to be washed. It is narrow and fits thru our 19 inch wide linen closet door where we store it.<br /><br />MEASUREMENT NOTE: The machine is around 17&#34; wide but the outlet drain hose does stick out the side and extra inch and half (so you have to add about 2 inches to the over width). The good thing here is that you have the option to switch the outlet drain hose to either the left or right side of the machine. You will also have to acknowledge that the inlet hose sticks up at the back and adds an extra 3 to 4 inches to the height (see the pictures I posted up).<br /><br />We had big leakage out the back and at the inlet connector during the first wash but once a proper wrench was used to tighten connectors with  thread seal tape there was no more leakage. We are only using this for our newborn clothes and burp clothes. This is a slight and most delicate machine so if you plan on washing heavy denim jeans, winter coats and shoes or you are using it every day then dont expect a long life out of this machine.<br /><br />The added BONUS is the spin cycle takes about 80% to 90% of the water out the clothes so you dont really need to buy a Dryer if you can spare 8 hours for line dry. Again we are only washing baby clothes so if you are washing heavy fabrics expect different results.<br /><br />Over all for the price this is a great product.."

Customer service is very nice......when I measured the temp on the sides of my 1st unit at 88 degrees, they felt something was wrong.  The replacement unit came this week, I plugged it in hoping for the best.  But the 2nd one is noisy, and the sides also warm up.  This might be nice in the dead of winter, but California is warm now, and A/C is going.<br />Guess it is good to know that the first unit is not a lemon, but one of a bunch.  I like the single unit compartment, I have the temp set for 60; the temp rises to 62 or 63, then the motor kicks in to cool.....that is when the sides heat up and the noise starts.  Wine is kept better than in my closet,<br />however thought this would be GREAT from the previous reviews.  Did no one notice the heat and noise???

Purchased new in October, 2014 - now, in August, 2015, I'm hoping against all hope to get rid of this turd once and for all.  Read on.<br />Do not under any circumstance even remotely consider purchasing this Samsung dishwasher.  If anyone suggests purchasing this appliance run, don't walk to the nearest fire exit.<br />Door leaks ad nauseum; 4 or 5 calls to date to Samsung &#34;warranty service&#34; for repairs, none of which have been effective in curing the problem.  About four minutes after start of a cycle we're greeted with the LE code (uhhh, that would be a leak - Doh) and we're then confronted with water leaking onto our new hardwood floor.  I don't think we've experienced more than 3 complete wash cycles since install without the leak[s].<br />Because of the repair history Samsung, two weeks ago agreed to purchase the dishwasher *back* from us.  The last correspondence from Samsung told me to not dispose of the dishwasher until final approval of . . . ???  What the bleep does *that mean?  I can't remove the turd even to replace it with a unit that does function?!  All follow up calls to Samsung &#34;executive level warranty service&#34; [Terrence: 201.727.5667] are not returned.<br />I'm thinking of bringing this burning bag of dog crap to the attention of our local media consumer advocacy folks - I'm fairly certain they'll have a field day with it!!<br />Here's an update - September 1, 2015:  I upgraded my review to 2 Stars based on Samsung's decision to refund the cost of the dishwasher.  Their [wise] decision was based on the number of unresolved repair issues associated with the leaks. They even offered to pay for any substantiated damage to our hardwood floor caused by the leaks.  If I could give their warranty/customer support center 5 Stars I would ... but I won't since their outstanding effort would not and could not correct a deficient product. But, thank you Samsung for doing the right thing."

The standard surge protectors are too small and not strong enough for the things like freezer, the oven or the washer and dryer. I was very excited to find this as just about a month ago we had a power outage and then when the power came back on, I was worried about surges doing damage. The instructions are easy enough to understand on the card it came with, but the sticker on the front of the surge protector is in another language, so I am sticking the little business card sized instructions on the wall next to where I plugged it into. I plugged in the stand alone freezer, and waited and the green light is on. It has other settings to fix if any issues come up, but I feel more secure knowing that at least my freezer is safe if we have more power outages and surges, which happens fairly often here. Now I just need to get one for every appliance and I'll be set!<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.

I am a nut about laundry and conserving energy.. I unfortunately did not choose this washer.. my husband thought it was a good deal and said \\""we have to get it\\"" on the last day that Lowe's was having 18 months free financing... so it was a spur of the moment purchase cuz I trusted his judgement, well let me tell you, that is the last time he gets to make any large purchase decisions ;)"

B00N1XAVDY,NewAir CC-100 250 Count Cigar Cooler,Major Appliances,1,"Simply the worst made storage product I've purchased.  First off, the manufacturer is pretty much clueless about cigars and storage.  They probably just made these as a gimmick more than for practical use.  I can't tell what kind of wood the shelves are. Feels and looks like red cedar but there is hardly any aroma to it.<br /><br />This has a major air circulation problem, once you fill the unit up, it will start to malfunction.  This is apparently a big problem with this product. Check cigar forums, it's a known and unaddressed problem.  I unfortunately did not do my research before getting this.  Don't make the same mistake.  The lack of circulation causes the unit to fritz out and have really bad temperature fluctuations. The lowest I've measured is 52 degrees and the highest is 78 degrees (room temp). This is all while the unit is set at 65 degrees. Next the unit cannot and will not maintain humidity, there is major air leakage in and out of the unit causing humidity to mirror room humidity. Beads can't keep up with it.<br /><br />The manufacturer is aware of these issues but their response is basically for you to return it to Amazon. Good thing I figure out these issues within 30 days. Bunk product that will do more harm to your collection than good."

I can see where that would add up so we are considering having an under the sink filter installed. I do like the different size options as well... we are using the middle size for iced tea, etc.. I will switch it to the smallest size for frozen blended drinks. It is a bit noisy but not to bad.. we just turn it off at night. So far so good!!!"

The sensors however were not. It took a few minutes to figure out which sensor in this kit needed to go where. (Two of them looked identical to me.)<br />Once that was figured out, it took me about an hour to replace all the parts and re-assemble the dryer.<br /><br />I had some damaged wires I replaced while doing this, the old element had badly oxidized terminal connectors which caused some arcing.<br /><br />Now our dryer works like brand new, I'm super happy with the result. Some other reviews suggested that the element would not last very long. Personally I'd order another one and replace in a year if need be. It's cheap to replace and would take about 20 minutes to replace just the heater element."

Update:  October 2015:  Now that every single part except the exterior of the machine has been replaced and technicians have come at least six times, it appears the machine is finally working properly -- without one error code in the last 10 washes and I have not taken any special, only reasonable, care to balance each load.

B008AOGMLY,CIT36XKB Masterpiece Series 36&quot; Wide Freedom Induction Cooktop Full Surface Cooking Auto Shut-Off Timer Child Safety Lock Hot Surface Indicator Light: Stainless,Major Appliances,5,"I wasn't sure how many stars to give this cooktop based on my experience, because I *adore* it, it is indeed the Holy Grail of cooktops, and one of the boards in mine failed 23 months after its installation.  Although it was just a little beyond two years past the purchase date, the customer service rep asked to see my installation paperwork.  Once he realized I had had the cooktop installed 23 months prior, he told me they would be able to honor the 2 year warranty for my $5,000 cooktop after all.  In-between the time he came to our house and ordered a new board, the other side started occasionally turning the burner off without warning about 3 minutes after I'd turned it on.  When I mentioned this to the rep upon his return to install the first board, he thought for a minute, and then declined to repair the first side because he didn't want to close out the problem ticket without installing a new board on the second side under the warranty!  So...I got two new boards on my $5000 cooktop, which come with a 1 year warranty, and Thermador Customer Service gets an 11 out of 10!!!  So very happy with Thermador's customer service and my newly restored fabulous cooktop, but I am left with a queasy feeling about their parts.  Hoping I never need their top-notch customer service again."

B000R9ABPI,Broan Allure 36-Inch Under Cabinet Mount Range Hood,Major Appliances,5,"I'm very pleased with this range hood! I bought it to replace one in my apartment that dated from the early 1970's. Yes, it was that hip color avocado green! I'd also cleaned about half the paint off and it just looked nasty and the light in it was crap. We'd looked at many range hoods in a big price range and because we don't own this property we didn't want to spend a lot to upgrade our range hood. This one had all the features I wanted; dual speed fan, dual lights and it's WHITE! It was also at least $100 less than an identical one I'd seen in a local store.<br />I'm loving how great the light is and the fan is efficient and very quiet! It's made me realize just how lame the old one was. I can actually see this fan pulling the steam up!<br />I also like the design, how the fan is lower in the back and the lights higher up in the front. Not sure how to say this but with the raised front I feel like I'm not as crowded when I stand at my cooktop. It's also really easy to clean; so far I just wipe it off every other day or so and it doesn't have that icky greasy feel my old one got. Hope that makes sense... I'd gladly buy this again when we do buy a house!"

I have owned 2 of them now.  Unfortunately both of them have a serious flaw which the manufacturer knows about and has not fixed. The cover at the top of the door (which covers the buttons and LED lights and is the handle to pull open the door) is made of thin plastic. After about 2 years of normal usage it simply breaks off. I know that the company is aware of the issue because I  worked with them to replace the first unit. I assumed that they would have fixed such an obvious flaw.  Well now I know that they did not. The second unit broke at the same place.

We have to keep protection on the flooring because the one guarantee that we can count on is that it will leak every time.The repair guy has been out five times and it still leaks.

B006JJKACY,Vinotemp 5.12 cu. ft Outdoor Refrigerator,Major Appliances,4,"The name implies that this is for outdoor use, but I am using this to replace a beverage center inside my house. The build is almost exactly the same as a beverage center, with similar shelves and all, but the door is solid instead of a window. I don't mind this because everyone opens the cooler to look for what's inside anyway. Also, the solid door makes this unit very efficient. It consumes about 250 kWh per year, as opposed to some other coolers that use 900+ kWh, which is more than most modern full size refrigerators that have 5 times the capacity. If you do the research on these coolers, a lot of them don't even state their energy usage which is a good hint that they are terribly wasteful.  The unit states that it has Dynamic Cooling which is marketing speak for a fan. The fan blows air around the unit so that temperatures are more uniform and you won't get those hot and cool spots. I've never really had a problem with nonuniform cooling in my old cooler, but hey, it can't hurt!  With the adjustable feet screwed all the way in, the unit measures almost exactly (minus 1/16 inch) 34 inches. Keep this in mind when measuring out the space.  Overall a nice looking, reasonably priced, and very energy efficient little cooler. One star off for a sorely missing handle."
B001DI5ALW,NewAir AW-121E 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,4,"I bought this model (AW-280E) about 31/2 years ago to stage a house but ended up keeping it. I and am now looking to upgrade but thought I would review it here. I bought from Air and Water Inc. Its a single zone and I have had no problem with it. As others have mentioned, this is not a high end cooler. It is quiet with only a little fan noise that dies down when it reaches temperature. The bottle lay out is a little tight but I have never tried to pack it full. Occasionally it will not reach the low set point, for me ~56F. When this happened the first time, I could not figure out what was going on. However, I pulled the unit out and found a square foam air filter over the fan on the back of the unit that was full of dust. I washed this filter out and put it back in. Presto, it went back to keeping temperature. This has happened twice in the three years I've had this and both times I was able to fix the problem by washing the filter. Nothing in the manual about cleaning this filter but it has worked for me. Overall, for the price I paid, it was worth it."

B0047Q7IO4,Brown Model WTM721KW,Major Appliances,1,"I didn't buy one of these ovens but it was installed in my apartment several years ago. My biggest complaint is how incredibly difficult it is to get this oven to maintain a constant temperature. If I want to bake something at 350 degrees I have to set it to at least 400. If I set it at 350 it never gets hotter than about 275. Then once I get it preheated to the temperature I want I have to constantly monitor it. I purchased an oven thermometer and that's the only way I can tell how hot it is. The temperature tends to vary all the time; I've had it jump from 350 to almost 500 in less than 10 minutes WITHOUT my touching the control! It will also go to the cold side..it's a real juggling act to keep a steady temperature.<br />I had a technician from our local Gas Company come to inspect the oven and calibrate it and he said he couldn't calibrate the thermometer because this oven doesn't have the part needed to do so! Unless the maker has updated this oven to include that feature, I wouldn't buy it. I've seen less expensive gas wall ovens in this size so do lots of research before you buy."

B003FSXVIW,Whirlpool Duet Sport : WFW8300SW 27 Front-Load Washer - white,Major Appliances,1,It was purchased to save water and electricity and replaced a 24 year old Kenmore.  Noisy and vibrates badly even when leveled. It has a trap to capture items from pockets but machine must be laid on back to open front panel for access to trap.  Had to replace pump due to an item that got through the trap.  When error codes occur the book which defined the codes is located inside front panel near the trap!  Cycles take much longer than top load machines.  Small loads do not spin well and have to be re-spun or wrung out by hand. Recently started making a scraping noise when tub turns; I'm told it's the tub bearing which cannot be replaced except by purchasing an entire tub.  Very expensive!  Worst appliance decision I ever made.

B0083H1INK,NewAir 126-Can Beverage Cooler,Major Appliances,5,"Like many other people who bought this unit, I was very disappointed when our cooler came and the door was dented.  Since the dents went OUT, it was clearly an issue with the way the door was put together.  Complicating the issue, I was home by myself when it arrived, so the only way I could get it the unit out of the box was to take the box apart.  NewAir couldn't have been better about it.  I emailed them a photo of the damage, and they shipped me out a new, perfect one so I could use the box to send back the first one.  We've had it for almost exactly a year and we LOVE it.  It's let us clear a ton of beverages out of our too-small-for-us kitchen fridge, and keeps everything perfectly cold.  We haven't found that it's especially noisy, and it looks very cool in our porch.  Once you get a good one, it's a great product!"

B00VLX20YY,Kalamera 28 Bottle Stainless Steel Freestanding Wine Refrigerator,Major Appliances,1,"Our Kalamera refrigerator arrived yesterday. It looks nice but doesn't work properly. The temperature only goes down to 63 degrees, not enough to keep even a few bottles of white wine semi-cool, let alone cold. The temperature adjustment controls look nice but don't work. You can adjust the temperature down to 54 degrees, but then it just jumps right back up to 63 degrees. So the controls are useless. As for Kalamera the company, there is no phone number to call for help. There isn't even an address. Nothing. About the only good thing from this sorry episode is that we bought the fridge from Amazon, which is taking it back at their expense without a hassle. $239--and didn't even get cold enough to keep the wine cool."

The lights are either all on or all off...<br /><br />The fan felt like it was drafting air really well when our contractor tested the unit (before mounting), but when we ran it for the first time it didn't suction air much at all. We will try again with tonight's dinner. :)<br /><br />Overall, it is a beautiful fixture. I think we just need to iron out the bugs."

There are burned into the opening plastic gasket for the washer.  The dryer also has clothing burn marks on the plastic boom on the sides.<br />The door won't seal shut so now there is tape to hold the door closed enough for the washer to run.

We consistently get condensation between the front doors which collects in the seal and lower drawer causing mold. I have a had repair guys out 3 times, but they still could not correct the problem. Combine that with the horrible designed middle and freezer drawers which always want to close on you and tend to dishevel everything you have carefully placed there when they slam shut. We finally got rid of this over-priced piece of junk and went back to a side-by-side fridge. Best thing we could have done. No regrets."

Top Freezer Refrigerator With Icemaker, White, Reversible Door Swing",Major Appliances,1,"I have had this refrigerator less than 2 weeks; I financed it through the Alabama Power Appliance store in Gardendale, AL. There has been ice and water in the freezer since it was plugged in. When I open it up drops of water and icicles fall on the floor. I have had to wipe water out of it two times a day!<br /><br />Service has already been called on it TWO TIMES. I have had to request vacation time to meet someone here on those two separate occasions, missing valuable time on the clock at work. Same repairman has been here both times to repair the unit; he has been professional and helpful to do the best he could to remedy the problems but what can you do when an appliance is poorly made? What has happened to quality and pride in America any longer? The first time he was here he put a washer/shim to get the freezer door to close properly. That did not work. Today he was advised to put caulk around the case/liner flange. My brand new refrigerator has caulk smears around the edges. The repairman did the best he could to clean it up but it looks awful.<br /><br />I usually research anything before I buy it. Car, electronics, appliances, etc. In this case, I made a terrible mistake and did NOT research this appliance's ratings. Terrible mistake. I don't know what I have to do to get my money back and either upgrade to another appliance. I am very displeased. I do not like being aggressive or rude about anything of this nature, but in this instance I am insisting for the appliance to be returned. I won't pay for something that has already had two service calls put on it in less than two weeks."

I did not pre-wash my dishes and in anticipation for this new dishwasher I did not bother to clean them for 2 weeks either.<br /><br />After letting it run on the heavy load it cleaned and dried all of my dishes perfectly, even the ones that weren't perfectly aligned. I used the finish all in one pods and it fit well in the 25g loader and finish Jet dry.

Neat White Stackable Electric Dryer - DV330AEW,Major Appliances,1,"CRACKED DRUM-- DEFECTIVE FROM FACTORY<br /><br />I, too, am one of the sad owners of this Samsung dryer. The dryer is about 2.5 years old, but the tum-TUM-tum-TUM sound has been going on for years but is getting much, much worse--and clothes are sticking. After about 3 hours of talking and writing to extremely unresponsive customer service agents, I FINALLY got Samsung to do at least something, namely, they will pay for the part (the drum) and I will pay for the labor. It's not all I was hoping for, but at least it's something. Of course, no repair has taken place yet, so perhaps in the end I will not be pleased at all (e.g., if Samsung in fact does not pay for the drum, or if the labor charge is over $250). In ANY case, I will never purchase another Samsung washer/dryer."

B00RNAH5OY,goFridge Mini Fridge Portable Electric Cooler,Major Appliances,2,"This fridge did not meet our expectations. Overall it's a nice looking fridge, however when it comes to performance it misses the mark. The first issue we had was the temperature setting, the lowest temperature you can set the fridge to is 38F, however the temperature readout on the front bezel indicates that the coldest it ever gets is 46F. Secondly, the door lock is really finicky, it requires a decent amount of force to properly engage it. If not properly engaged, you can expect to have semi-chilled contents inside your fridge. Lastly, and this is the biggest issue we've had, is the condensation inside the fridge. For some reason, this fridge creates and exorbitant amount of condensation inside it, so much so that we've had to line the bottom of the inner compartment with a towel, which we replace daily, in order to soak up all the condensation. When we replace this towel every morning, it is fully saturated with water (aka dripping wet).  We've contacted the manufacturer regarding this and they've been of little to no help. They asked us to ensure that the door was fully locked, and that we weren't using it in a high humidity environment, two criteria which we met. Given that the market selection for other fridges of this capacity is lacking, we have come to terms with having to swap out wet towels every morning and triple checking our door lock. Unless you really need a fridge this size, I would recommend getting something else that is either smaller or larger than the goFridge."
B003JN143C,Whirlpool WTW5600XW Cabrio 3.6 Cu. Ft. White Top Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"After considerable research including a favorable review by Consumer Reports, I purchased this machine during December, 2011.  Overall, I was satisfied until three weeks ago when it stopped working; no power at all.  As one might guess, this happened during the middle of a wash cycle and the soapy clothes had to be removed and the water in the tub emptied by hand.  A service technician determined it was the main control board, part #W10480108.  Whirlpool 1-800 253-1301 (US) sells a replacement board through their authorized parts centers, Marcone.com 1-877 486-2371. The initial charge is $306.03, with a credit of $60 when the defective board is returned to them, for a final cost of $246.03.  Add to this the service charge from the technician.  Considering that this machine had light, infrequent use and cost more than $650 new, the price of the part and the repair are unreasonable.  Although other reviews note the same part defect, Whirlpool feels no culpability.  This is not your mom or dad's Whirlpool and these models are not made to last.  I won't buy another Whirlpool (or Maytag which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool)."

It looks beautiful, but if you leave even one crumb on a plate or a cup you get an E24 error - failure to drain.  You must bail out water, and clean the filters looking for any tiny particle that has jammed up the washer. I am spending more time fixing clogs than if I just did my washing by hand.  The first time I had to call a technician he told me &#34;yeah, these Bosch washers are more sanitizers than washers - they are very touchy.&#34;<br /><br />When I bought this at a big box home care center I specifically stated that I wanted a robust dishwasher that I could have my kids load messy dishes into and have them come out clean.

The stove is in the island in the middle of the kitchen, so we needed something not too big, allows for sight lines and also isn't too low to stovetop with a just over 7 foot ceiling.  After searching for a long time, my husband found this.  When trying to install it, the hood is much lower than expected, cutting sight lines and looks too close to stove.  We are keeping it, because we couldn't find anything else, but my husband is going to trim it down so that it doesn't come so far down from the ceiling."

Within one year I took it back to the manufacturer to replace one of the circuit boards as it failed miserably.  Because it was a year later, they wanted me to pay for shipping... so when I discovered they are located in Santa Ana, CA., only an hour from my home I drove it to them.  Nearly a week later it was fixed, no charge.. well good for them.  Has worked nicely, except the temperature reading gauges NEVER matched the actual temperature, as I placed a gage inside to check.  AND the fan is a bit loud.  Well here it is August of 2015, 3 1/2 years later... or actually 2 1/2 years later, and the unit beeps, the gages flicker and switch from 0 to 55 (gage inside reads 65 degrees).  I have unplugged, cleaned, vacuum, moved away from all obstructions.. but to no avail.  So, I am once again looking for a wine refrig...  I do NOT recommend Whynter procducts."

First worry ---- arriving dinged up. No need for that ---- it was so very well packed it seemed the only way to mess it up was to heave it with a catapult. Second ---- it is quiet (though this could be relative). Love that the handle is recessed --- which is why I took the white one. Will update later if the performance should become sub-par."

About 3 months ago the fan speed (and associated noise) started wavering and the temperature indicator lights dimmed and brightened in unison with the fan speed.  Annoying as heck, but it was still maintaining the correct temperatures.  As of yesterday, the bottom zone of the unit is not cooling.  Would love to hear from others as to what they replaced their Edgestar units with.  The only other comparable units on Amazon (20-29 bottles, dual zone, 4 stars or more) are made by Koldfront (the same company as Edgestar) and Wine Enthusiast (which gets 2 out of 5 stars by reviewers on wineenthusiast.com."

We are a very athletic family and our clothes sink. It does not wash the clothes properly. I wash in hot water always to see if it helps but it does not. I've tried expensive and inexpensive detergents. Still the same. I even add borax to my loads as a boost. The bleach area is completely rusted and in the area around the detergent drawers. Some of our clothes are spotted and ruined with orange dots. I will never by Samsung again or a front loader. Not worth it. I can't wait to go back to an old school washer with an agitator.

It washes your clothes really good. And the spin dryer works pretty well once you remove them from it they usually take a hour at most to air dry.  You guys up the price? The previous pricing for $200 dollars in August of 2015 was the right price. This washer isn't worth $240 dollars for that price you might as well go buy a commercial brand.

The technician came out and diagnosis it with cam and motor failure on the bottom, estimate cost of $300 parts and labor replacement. I gave 3 stars regardless of the &#34;not so clean and enough water to wash comment&#34; as it lasted for 4 years already. On the first 3 years of its' life, we dida load of wash every week, and not until we have our kids. We used it every other day and this stress test put the work on the machine and perform the &#34;reliability test&#34;. I am disappointed as Whirlpool used to be a reputable brand and washer should last more than 10 years without failure."

B00IBHK400,Deflect-o Dryer duct Cleaning Brush Kit DVBRUSH12K/6,Major Appliances,5,I bought these to clean out my dryer vent after my heating element burnt out. I wanted to make sure a clogged dryer vent didn't cause it to burn out among other things. I was worried this wouldn't work because my dryer vent has two sharp turns and is made of a cheaper foil material. I had no issues at all with the curves or with damaging the ventilation. I didn't hook it up to a drill just to be cautious so I wouldn't tear the ventilation. Highly recommend.

The only way you can buy the filter from Samsung is through J&J Int'l and they are terrible.  They say if you open the filter you cannot return it.  But you won't know if it fits unless you open it.

Best for use if you can watch each process for up to 6 hours.  But it does eventually work - even if you won't remember what you did to get it right."

Not sure if this is normal or safe, so I've submitted a question about it. For now, I'll give it a 3 star review for looks and the slightly annoying BANG! the door makes when it closes, pending any heating and an answer to my question. I'll update then. I'm attaching pictures of the gap.<br /><br />UPDATE (9/26/2015): Well, the gap doesn't seem to be a normal feature, but it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the microwave oven in any way. I mostly use it for heating up leftovers and it works great for that purpose, have not tried it for any serious cooking. The loud door is far more tolerable now after a few uses, barely noticeable.

B00PGFGVB6,EasyGoDryer - Portable Electric Air Drying Clothes Dryer,Major Appliances,4,"I tried the EasyGoDryer; but I wasn't sent a good one.  It already had little holes from the metal bar pulling on the sewn in &#34;holders&#34;.  The carry bag had some white spots on it which I washed off.  The dryer itself had a scuff type of scratch.  If it would have been packaged correctly, it migh have received a better rating.  I have a two year warranty so I am covered for a longer time.  It can't remove lint so, I didn't know enough about this product."

B00NO7OGCO,AKDY 30-Inch 3-Speed Stainless Steel Under Cabinet Range Hood AZ-W0175,Major Appliances,3,"Good looking hood but the force of the fan is a little weak.

Can't understand how PC RICHARD'S could have sold me this lemon in 2014.  One repair and it still freezes up, grinds and leaks.  Consumer Reports should have tested it for a year before rating it; after 1 year it's finished.  If this were a car I'd be covered under the Lemon Law.  Ralph Nader, where are you??"

B002VUC9V0,"Soleus Air WA2-02-50 New Aqua Sub Water Cooler, with hot and cold settings and Bottom-load design",Major Appliances,1,I bought this water cooler and from the beginning I was having trouble with the float sticking finally the cooler quit all together.  Called the manufacture and mailed them the cord and they mailed a new one.  When it was unpacked the hot and cold water both were 197 degrees.  Called the manufacture again and mailed them another cord and received a new one 8/15/15 and unpacked it 8/16/15 and this one doesn’t work either.  Now the water is getting cold but no hot water and the water will not lump up from the bottle.  So now this is 2 coolers that don’t work from the beginning.  Seems like something is wrong here.  Now the manufacture don’t want to do anything else.

B0052YH4S0,"Bosch SHE3AR56UC Ascenta 24"" Black Full Console Dishwasher - Energy Star",Major Appliances,1,"SHE3ARF6UC. The door latch keeps breaking and the repair guy (SO glad we bought the extra warranty) has had to repair twice.  Which if the door doesn't latch, the things doesn't operate.  The repair people know this is a design flaw - WHY does BOSCH sell something so terrible?  He will have to come out again before we can return the darn thing.  Since it is German made, it takes at least a week for them to receive ordered parts.  This thing has literally spent more time waiting on parts than being used since we purchased it.  We know people who have owned Bosch's and are really happy with it - guess we got a lemon.  Good points - it's really quiet and I like how it counts down the time in the cycle.  More negatives - not user friendly and it doesn't operate like it should.  Your supposed to be able to scroll through the settings and hit Start.  Sounds simple, but it doesn't work like its supposed to.  It keeps getting hung up at different places along the way and then you have to reset everything which is not a simple process."

B002ZV0OJO,NewAir AW-121E 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,3,"Quiet it is not! Does not have the sound of a motorcycle being accelerated in a wheelie but not quiet.<br /><br />There is a constant high pitched whine that I assume is from the Thermoelectric cooling system. The fan, when it starts makes the operation even more annoying. Sound of any kind is vibration based. Therefore if you are need  to store your wines free of vibration this unit is not for you. Good for household wines that will not be stored for long periods and/or vibration will not cause a noticeable deleterious effect."

B003JN530M,Samsung DV330AEW 7.3 Cu. Ft. Neat White Stackable Electric Dryer - DV330AEW,Major Appliances,1,"I would have given this dryer a zero star rating if possible. Prior to this W/D set, we had a GE set that lasted 20 years without any problems.  We gave that set to our college student and bought this Samsung set about 3 years ago.  The washer has been OK but the dryer has been nothing but trouble.  I have changed the heater thermistor 4 times and 2 weeks ago it started making a thumping noise.  I discovered that the drum has cracked right where the seam was welded together but the crack has traveled outside the seam.  This will cost about $300 just for the part if I do the repair myself.  Samsung should be ashamed of manufacturing this junk."

I was worried since side by side, it does not exactly look like the GE manufacturer's one that I had but I did not have any leaks.  There were no instructions but I just matched up orientation with the one I took out and made sure it went in the same way and gave it a firm push.  I did discard the first few gallons (used it to water plants) to get out the air and any manufacturing debris.  I have only used one of the 4-pack so far but if I have a positive with all four, I will update.  It will take a couple of years though since they do last at least 6 months."

It did come with some minor cosmetic issues (a ding/dent or two), which I attribute to shipping and delivery. No big deal there, and to be (somewhat) expected after reading other reviews. Sometimes I will hear this appliance making a slightly louder than normal humming noise, which I hope is not a sign that the product will not last long (as other reviewers have stated). For me, right now, its doing its job and I enjoy the extra freezer space. No real complaints at this time, but will update if anything does happen to malfunction."

B000FAR33M,Danby DAR195BL 1.8 cu.ft. All Refrigerator -  Black,Major Appliances,3,".<br /><br />Pro's:<br />- Perfect size for my application as it fits nicely and hides away in a wall unit.<br />- I preferred black.<br />- Good price.<br /><br />Con's:<br />- The little guy is a bit noisy.<br />- Some trouble setting to right temp.  Setting will seem okay when you check it over a few days, but if you don't open it for a few weeks you may find that sodas and water freeze if not stored on door racks. I had a soda cans explode and a few bulge at top and bottom due to freezing liquid.<br />- Had to buy a fridge thermometer to try to manage temps and check at least once every couple of weeks<br /><br />On balance I am happy.  However, if I where to do this over again I'd try to find a small box with digital temp control.  Not sure it if exist, but I'd look around for it for sure."

B00D8WA520,"Blomberg BRFB1800SSIM Fridge with Bottom Freezer, Ice Maker, 18 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,1,"This is a beautiful machine, with one serious flaw in a Faulty Ice Maker. My initial refrigerator BRFB1800SSIM had an ice maker that would not release ice cubes and had water freezing in the ice bin. A repairman was sent to replace the ice maker unit. The problem was not resolved. Blomberg's service provider Eastern Marketing noted this was a known problem. A fix from the factory was pending for several months from late 2014, but by mid-2015, Eastern Marketing concluded a completely new refrigerator would have to be installed. A year after initial contact, a new BRFB1822SSL was delivered, and installed (at my expense). The ice maker again failed after 2-3 weeks. The design of the ice maker is faulty. Ice does not release from the ice tray, and water flows over the ice tray, further freezing the tray in place. Excess water flows into the ice bin and freezes. The cycle repeats and the tray becomes increasingly caked with ice, further preventing ice from dropping out of the tray.  Update 1: It is currently 2015-12-29 and I am still awaiting a response from Eastern Marketing and Blomberg. See reviews for BRFB1800SSIM.  Update: As of January 2016, the ice-maker was redesigned and installed on my replacement BRFB1822SL with a quick 30-minute service visit. The new design is improved by over-torquing the ice tray, twisting the tray gently to ensure the ice separates from the tray. The ice tray rotates twice per tray-refilling cycle, allowing &#34;two tries&#34; to twist the ice out of the tray. The amount of water dispensed into the tray is reduced, thereby making smaller ice cubes and preventing joint ice-cubes from consolidating on the tray. I am satisfied enough to improve my rating to 4 Stars, with one deducted for the previous inconvenience discussed above. I never thought I'd be so happy to hear the sound of ice falling into a tray.  Update 2: I spoke too soon... After 3-4 successful batches of ice, the problem re-occurred. This time the water misses the ice tray completely, spewing water all over the ice-bin. Beyond unbelievable. I will post a video shortly."

To date, we have spent $687.86 on repairs all to ice maker issues. It has has been replaced twice - both times out of the year warranty. The reason I know this is because today I put together a spreadsheet of all the invoices to send to Samsung and to Lowes where we purchased it. We have the appliance guys coming out yet again because it is not cooling properly. THIS HAS BEEN A DUD!!!!!!"

I searched my favorite online store and came across this hood.  I absolutely love it. The look is clean and contemporary. I paired many unique pieces around this hood(the pot filler was also purchased from Amazon).  I get many compliments when someone see it for the first time. The hood comes with 2 pieces for the chimney but I had the chimney custom cut because my ceilings are 12 feet high and I wanted one clean look. You will not go wrong with this purchase.  Also, the price is beyond great.  Most people think I paid lots for the hood."

B002MPLYEW,"Danby 120 Can Beverage Center, Stainless Steel DBC120BLS",Major Appliances,5,"Delivered ahead of schedule (2 days).  Outside carton in excellent condition.  Inside carton and packing in perfect condition.  Unit was well packed.  I was a little worried about it from reading the reviews.  Packaging will easily sustain some level of rough handling.  The unit was delivered (left in front of my garage) right-side up, so I did not feel a need to wait to plug it in (oils in coils issue).  I moved it right-side up on a dolly, and unpacked it that way as well.  Plugged it in, started right up, and within the anticipated time period, about 4 hours, drinks were chilled.  After reading the reviews, I had some concerns about the shelves not supporting upright cans due to the spacing of the grill.  Not to worry.  If this was ever a problem, it is no longer an issue.  Shelves are attractive (black), with a spacing between rods of 1/2 inch.  I am extremely satisfied with the Danby, and would emphatically recommend it.  By the way - it looks nice too."

B00NXRHIO8,Samsung Counter Top Microwave,Major Appliances,4,"After my old Samsung microwave finally gave up the ghost after 12 years of faithful service, I wanted to get as close a replacement unit as I could get. This Samsung model was the best match size wise.<br />The price of this model has been fluctuating from ~$140 to ~$220. Track the price and don't pay too much!<br />Although this model is advertized as &#34;stainless steel&#34;, only the front bezel is stainless steel, the rest of the unit is painted black. The membrane front panel keys require a lot of precision and force to operate.<br />The grill function is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't work consistently. The instruction manual is confusing when explaining the grill function. By trial and error, I discovered that frozen baguettes and pizzas come out wonderful, but chicken nuggets and fish fingers -- not so much.<br />The unit has extra insulation for the grill function. For shorter cooking times, the oven works like a 1000W unit, but longer times, it heats up like a lot more powerful unit. The insulation may also contribute to the fact that microwave is very quiet in operation.<br />All in all, this is a worthy replacement to my departed Samsung. Hopefully it'll last as long as well."

B00DYJNNWQ,"Luma Comfort IM200SS Portable Clear Ice Maker, 28-Pound",Major Appliances,1,"Update 6-10-16: There is no fixing bad design and bad parts.  Luma would not warranty their crap product.  Ice maker is now in the landfill.    Update 2-22-16 : Luma took the ice maker back for repair.  Two weeks after repair the same problem is happening.  Their &#34;fix&#34; did not last.  We have contacted them again and are awaiting a response.  Update 12-15-15 from 5 to 2 stars:  Overtime the unit is overfilling the lower reservoir.  The sensor will not shut off the valve allowing all of the water from the top to flow into the bottom.  This is happening at a constant rate now and have reached out to Luma for support.  Will update again upon a positive troubleshoot.  Prior Review: Finally a portable ice maker that makes sense. It creates perfectly clear ice thanks to the industrial design of always having water move over the cooling elements. It makes ice fast.  It also doesn't drip water onto your counter like others that condensate on the door and when you open and close spew water over the edges.  I dislike freezer made ice, it's design is all wrong for a round glass.  My last portable ice maker, bullet style, finally corroded the wiring from its door condensation issue and wasn't worth the fix.  This ice melts slower than the bullet. The machine is more quiet and the paddle stop is so much smarter than the temp sensor. No more empty tray because one cube got hung up on the sensor!  If you are an ice snob looking for professional results get this machine."

B00KVPU108,"SPT RF-244SS Compact Refrigerator, Stainless, 2.4 Cubic Feet",Major Appliances,5,"My husband chose this refrigerator to assist him in his small-scale home brewing hobby.  He plans to make lager, which has to sit at between 45 - 55 degrees F.  He reminds me to emphasize that he brews in 2 gallon batches, because a more typical 5 gallon container would not fit in this compact refrigerator.  He is sure that the refrigerator will maintain the desired temperature, but we will have to wait to see.  Right now, we are trying to fool some conifer seeds into believing that they are having a winter dormancy at just above freezing, something they would not experience here in San Francisco.  When the poor, confused seeds are ready to be planted, he will begin the beer project.  Ah, retirement!<br /><br />The refrigerator is in our garage.  I am often down there and never hear more than a very quiet hum and a slight pop.  The unit is attractive enough to keep in  a home bar or rec room.

It appeared to be a good unit at a great price point compared to what the local stores had available at the time. It arrived quickly and on time with adequate packaging. It included all new hardware and directions for installation. The install went so easy that I practically installed it with one hand since a had the other wrapped in a bandage after surgery. My wife is very happy to have it back in order with a working light and fan. The fan might not be the most quiet on the market but it is much better than what we had. I highly recommend this product and seller.

B003MNKT80,"Amana 21.9 cu. ft. Bottom-Freezer Refrigerator, ABB2224WEW, White",Major Appliances,1,"I purchased this model in May 2012 and the upper compartment functions okay. HOWEVER, about a year later, just after the warranty ran out, the bottom of the freezer began icing up, and it continues to rattle at night as the ice layer builds up and contracts. Two repairmen have not made it any better, even by telling me to &#34;close the freezer door in a special way, only on the right side&#34;. Not true. Now, maybe once a week I need to break up the approx. 1/2&#34; ice sheet with a long handled heavy teflon spatula (never with metal) and break up the ice, slide the chunks out the bottom of the freezer onto a large baking sheet, and empty in the sink. If I don't keep it ice free, the ice builds on the sides and over the motor. Amana has lost their reliable reputation. My previous Amana lasted 20 years."

B002MPLYEW,"Danby 120 Can Beverage Center, Stainless Steel DBC120BLS",Major Appliances,2,"There are two main issues with this minifridge.  Firstly the rubber seal around the door does not provide a snug fit.  There is clear daylight that you can see right through.  This should be airtight to keep the cool air in and warm air out.  Second this is meant to be a free standing fridge but on a level surface it rocks from side to side.  The manufacturer provides one leveling leg that screws in and out on one corner of the minifridge, what about the other 3 corners, how can one leg provide support.  At this price point I should not have to place cardboard under each corner to make it level.  I was expecting more after reading all the glowing reports but sorely disappointed with this item."

And there is NO information about how to replace a bunt out bulb in either the manual or online. Terrible customer service.<br /><br />Since the lights only last about a year, it is very annoying to have to hire someone to replace them. This is a terrible DESGN FLAW which the Bosch repairman will attest to (he spent 40 minutes trying to do it), but Bosch continues to manufacture these. Look for something else, since this is a very expensive unit (and then requires the installation fee). Run away from a Bosch appliance as fast as you can!!!!1"

When I found the problem I called there service rep and after about 5 days the rep advised me she was going on vacation for two weeks and could not help me till she got back. There was no one else to call or contact in the company. I contacted Amazon about the problem and  someone from the company contacted me about the problem and did send me a longer duct that did work. It took about 5-6 weeks to get the problem resolved. But the unit is installed and I am very happy with it.

B00MG1FT5M,POWER PAIR SPECIAL-LG Turbo Series ultra Large Capacity Laundry System With Steam Technology (WM3570HVA_DLEX3570V_WDP4V X 2) *GRAPHITE STEEL COLOR*,Major Appliances,5,"\\""LG\\"" means \\""Life's Good\\"" and trust me when I say that this washer and dryer has just made my life much easier. Life really is good when you have pedestals to raise the washer and dryer to a Laundromat type level. It is so much easier to get wash in and out of the washer and dryer. Before I was really having trouble with my old washer and dryer, mostly because the buttons were not working right and it was difficult to get clothes out of the washer and into the dryer.<br /><br />Now as far as research goes I read all about this set before I bought it. It had all the fun features I knew I'd love. But it was a surprise when I heard all the cute sounds this washer and dryer make. There are little tunes that are played at the end of the cycles which makes me happy. It is so much better than an annoying beeping sound.<br /><br />I would have to say that \\""user friendly\\"" is an understatement when talking about how easy this set is to use. With just a few turns of a knob and the pressing of a few buttons you can customize your experience. I have tried about ten options on the washer so far but there are even more to try. You can do regular cycles like cotton or perma press or delicates. There are also cycles for towels and whites. If you have allergies you will love the allergiene cycle which does take about an hour and a half but leaves sheets very, very clean. There is also a sanitary cycle a heavy duty cycle and speed wash cycle. I tried the speed wash cycle and it was only fifteen minutes. This was handy as I just needed to wash a few items. Now I don't have to wait for my favorite clothes. I can wash and dry them very quickly.<br /><br />The only cycle I had issues with on the washer was the perma press cycle with cold water. I tried washing my husband's and my clothes together and with cold water the scent of his deodorant got on all my clothes. So next I did a prewash (with Clorox 2) and extra rinse and used warm water. That turned out great and my clothes were fresh and clean. So I don't think I'll be using cold water as much with this machine. The washer also has a rinse and spin cycle but not a simple spin cycle.<br /><br />The only thing I had trouble washing so far was a very heavy flannel duvet/comforter cover. It simply would not spin. So I had to wring it out in the bathtub and finally got enough water out of it so I could put it in the dryer. So when they say \\""bulky\\"" items not everything heavy is going to work. But small blankets came out great. Like the kind you use on a baby's bed or cat bed.<br /><br />The washer also has a child lock option for if you have small kids. There is also an option to customize a cycle. So if you do a similar kind of laundry all the time this will save you some time as it saves your cycle and remembers it.<br /><br />The dryer is also very easy to use. You can turn a knob to select steam, small load, heavy duty, bulky/large, perm press, delicates, towels, speed dry and air dry. There is also a way to download another cycle of your choice. Both the washer and dryer work with cell phones. You can select a cycle and then change the dry level, temperature, time and signal. The dryer comes with a rack so you can dry shoes or delicates that you have to lay flat. There is an easy iron option if you don't want clothes you want to iron to dry completely before ironing. And there is a cool wrinkle care option that will tumble clothes longer until you get the chance to get them out of the dryer.<br /><br />What I really like about both the washer and dryer is the indicator symbol lights. You always know how much time is left and you can see a little symbol that tells you how far along the cycle is. There is also a child lock feature on the dryer. The dryer also has a custom setting for your favorite cycle. For safety there is a little \\""flow sense duct blockage sensing system.\\""<br /><br />Really this washer and dryer have it all. Just make sure to really read the manuals before using. There are some safety issues like you want to disconnect the power when cleaning the filter on the washer, etc. The dryer filter is also very easy to clean.<br /><br />If housekeeping seems like drudgery to you trust me when I say that once you get this washer and dryer laundry will become fun again. What was the most fun was fluffing up my feather pillows on air dry. That only took a few minutes.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewfety issues like you want to disconnect the power when cleaning the filter on the washer, etc. The dryer filter is also very easy to clean.<br /><br />If housekeeping seems like drudgery to you trust me when I say that once you get this washer and dryer laundry will become fun again.

B0055UBB4O,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,3,"Works well enough for my purposes. Just the right size. I dig the 1 touch feature for 30 seconds (start) and minutes (number buttons). It's also good that it has the removable glass rotator thingy. What brings the star count down are the button sizes themselves – super tiny, and the handle. While this microwave is nice and light and the door seals well, that doesn't make for a good combination for opening the door. So I have to hold one side to apply opposite pressure to open the door. I think this could be solved with some super rubber feet, but I shouldn't have to add them myself."

Was higher, and stainless cleaner was missing, but they made it right.  I got this one with no dent or dings, and it worked out of box.  Very happy with it, fan is powerful compared to what Ive seen in box stores.  The vent pipe that comes most likely will not be long enough. If you have a 8 foot ceiling, to install this right for the top you will need to cut of the top stainless pieces unless you mount between joist.  I used a steal cutting disk that did a very good job, took some time though.  If you have a 8.5-9' ceiling your good to go.  It was to late for me, but if you order this and have a 9&#34; ceiling, I would suggest asking if they can cut it before sending, even if it cost little."

It has always run very loud - thankfully, I keep this in a room not used too frequently so not a big issue for me but this would be a huge problem if it were in my kitchen.  Stopped cooling in less than 3 years.  Called Summit, waited 40 minutes to get a name of a appliance service company (Mr. Appliance).  When I called them, they told me they don't service my area (not part of their contracted coverage area with Summit - WTF?).  Back to waiting on hold for another 40 minutes....  Apparently there is a 4 year warranty on the compressor and I'm waiting to find out if that is the issue.  Hopefully that is the issue but I'll still have to pay for service."

It doesn't come with OEM hose retainers, and instead relies on weak O-rings to 'hold' the hoses in place.

The tank had a leak in it where the valve body is pressed into the tank (non-repairable), also the regulators were crap, hard to turn the pressure knobs. Its all just seemed cheap. Being that the pressure is one of the most important aspects of the setup, I went with a Tap-rite set up. As far as noise, it is as expected for a fridge, definitely can hear it run, but not too overly loud. I keep it in my kitchen. I also added the tower cooler right away to minimize any foaming due to change in temp at the tower/tap. The fridge definitely gets cold enough. I kept a glass of water in the bottom to use to measure the temp and it had no problem freezing it with room to spare. One other item to note, is that the tap is spring loaded where you have to hold it open while pouring. I don't like this, especially when filling pitchers"

B000DZDPIG,"Builders Best 010130 4"" X 5' Aluminum EZ-Fasten™ Pipe Dryer Duct",Major Appliances,5,"Great product.  Just what you need for a dryer hookup with clamp and adapter, too. Nice quality.  I was installing a Fantech secondary dryer filter downstream of my Samsung dryer after discovering that the lint filter in the dryer isnt worth a tinkers damn and lots of lint is getting past it.  This was never a problem on my old dryer but is on my new dryer, especially since it vents into the attic.  Nothing like vacuuming dryer lint out of your attic on a hot day.  So, I added the secondary filter box as Phase I of dryer vent mods and will add a soffit vent next.<br /><br />Meanwhile I needed some accessory parts and pieces so I bought this.  It arrived really quickly; just in the nick of time, and as it turned out, the manufacturer of the dryer lint box did not include all the parts and pieces, but this kit includes a nice quality hose that is preshaped for ease of connection, along with a sleeve adapter (which was just what I needed) and a clamp.  perfect for adding a single dryer.  In my case, I needed one extra set of clamps and some Shurtape aluminum duct tape to finish the job (and lots of patience), but it turned out great, thanks to this product."

B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,4,"I needed two portable ice makers and had space limitations in placement, this one had the dimensions which would work. 1st one came in two days ago, and I started it up. Simple controls, and the machine is relatively quiet for an ice maker. Left it on all night, and it appears to be recycling o.k. It's small; however, dimensions are iaw with description. Design is great, and looks good (and fits) in a lot of different locations. The only shortcoming I can see at this point is the ice is wet (which I guess is described as &#34;soft ice&#34; in previous reviews. It sticks together when placed in the freezer wet, so an ice pick is need unless you open the freezer and shake the ice 2 or 3 times as it is turning into hard ice. I'm going to let this run for 24/7 and see if it still performs the same. 5 pounds of ice a day for a year = 1825 a year (or 182 bags). Do the math. This should pay for itself (based on current price) in 6 months if it holds out. I like it thus far at this price point, and... Read more"

B00DNSO41M,Haier  Wine Cellar with Electronic Controls,Major Appliances,4,"Ok, so it's been a month since I received this so I think It's ok to give a proper review for now.  I'll give an update around 6 months.<br /><br />As far as the concerns on the for there only being 3 legs go:  This is 100 percent correct.  There are only 3 legs, and the hinge for the door is designed to act as the 4th leg.  It holds up perfectly well and I have absolutely no complaints regarding that.<br /><br />The dual zone temperature feature is something I absolutely love!  This way I can keep my reds and whites at the correct temperatures.  The light however only works on the top zone.  There is no light on the bottom.  Not a big deal in my book.<br /><br />All in all, I'm completely satisfied with this wine fridge.  It cools adequately and remains at the set temperature so long as it doesn't get too hot in my apartment.  However, I did go on a trip a couple of weekends ago and set my home thermostat to 80 and when I got back, the temperature in the fridge for the coldest zone had actually raised from 46 to 55.  (Still remained cold enough though)."

Guess what, It broke again this year (August 2015) and this time the GE technician said both washer and dryer are not worthy to fix it because the cost to repair them is more than to buy a new set.

Another $280.<br />3 years old, temperature control failed, and(yes, you guessed it!), fan failed again.<br />Only Samsung trained repair people can service their appliances because of the overly complicated electronics.<br />With each failure we lost hundreds of dollars worth of food. Tried dealing with Samsung to get some money back for either the repairs, or at the very least the spoiled food. No such luck. Samsung only warranties the appliance for 1 year. Samsung is also very complicated as far as customer service. The attitude is &#34;you bought it, you're the foolish one&#34;.<br />Avoid Samsung appliances."

B00EJPHJVK,Fantech Lint Trap for Dryer Booster - DBLT4W (White),Major Appliances,2,"Overpriced and poorly constructed.  Instructions are beyond useless and needed accessories are omitted. Installing this was a frustrating experience.  And I am an engineer myself and thought i had all the right parts, but found out I was wrong.  I even called Tech Support to explain and complain.  They were able to track down why I was having issues.  Here is what you need to know:  1. One port is slightly larger than the other, as they made this unit only to be mounted in non-flex 4&#34; duct.  However, the box is symmetrical and neither port is marked.  One is 4' in exterior diameter and the other is about 3.85&#34; in diameter.  No markings of any kind, so beware of this point, as once you remove the face/inner filter, it is easy to get the box turned around.  2. As I pointed out to Tech Support and they agree, but have no explanation for WHY - the lint filter, which is attached to the face of the unit at the same angle as the handle, DOES NOT TOUCH THE BACK OF THE BOX.  Thus, there is an air gap of about 1/4&#34; to 3/8&#34; between the inner edge of the lint filter and the back of the box.  This provides a LINT BYPASS which makes no sense at all.  It is, after all, a lint trap.  Tech Support is aware that customers are frustrated by this and resolving it with peel and stick foam window insulation, which is $2.50 per roll.  3. Tech Support is also aware that the face of the box leaks air.  Once again, you have to use some foam window seal tape, such as MD foam window seal for Small Gaps, or similar product.  What is not clear until you get one in hand, is that you pull on the handle and the whole front (white) face of the box comes out and the filter is attached perpendicular to the face.  So, if the face does not fit tight, it leaks.  And that means it leaks hot air into your space, and for many, it means it leaks RADON GAS into your space.  Not a lot, but in some areas we have radon in the ground water, and when you dry clothes, you want that hot moist air, which could contain radon, to vent outside, not leak into your garage or utility room or condo.  In short, we spent 3 hours modifying (insulating) and installing and field engineering this to get it to work.  It is installed and working now and catching lint.  But, for the price, this product should include the following:  * 2 - 4&#34; screw clamps * 2- 4&#34; sleeve adapters (almost impossible to install without this!) * 4 mounting screws * one roll of self adhesive foam insulation tape and instructions on how to add it to the lint filter and the door face - BETTER YET, install this  at the factory in China and make the box air tight BEFORE you sell it! * Better instructions.  Nowhere in the instructions are the problems described above mentioned, nor is there any info that points out that one port is narrower than the other and should be used as the INLET (they look the same until you measure them, but they are different diameters).  The instructions only cover installation for fixed 4&#34; duct with an inline fan, and not for other applications.  Duh!  Why not?  All in all this product is barely usable for my application as a secondary lint filter with flex connectors on each side, but yet this is EXTREMELY COMMON APPLICATION.  The manufacturer needs to rework this product to make it easier to use and make it more comprehensive.  Buyer beware.  You will need a lot of extra parts and pieces to make this work."

This dishwasher is poorly laid out, undersized, has terrible utensil holders, poorly thought out tines, rack orientation, etc. This dishwasher was newly installed in our house shortly before we bought the house, so it did not cost us anything extra. Other than not leaking, this dishwasher has zero positive attributes. Save yourself the grief, and do not buy it. This one will go to Habitat for Humanity, though I do so with some guilty feeling.

It's actually kind of scary and shocking. I bought the extended warranty at Lowe's and a repairman is coming out in a couple of days, but I am pretty sure we will hear some weird excuses and maybe get a temporary repair.  READ MORE REVIEWS before buying one - I am just one of many, many bad reviews......all with the same problems.  Maytag people are not helpful....they just apologize and say there is nothing they can do.  Maytag used to have a good reputation......not any more.  YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH AN LG OR A SAMSUNG.

I use it to keep a couple cans of soda and maybe a sandwich cold under my desk at work.<br /><br />The fan on it is a little noisy, it isn't a problem at work because of the general hum of A/C and computers, but when I had it in my bedroom it bothered me a little. I recommend buying an 80mm computer case fan that is advertised as 'silent' or 'low noise'. Replacing the fan is fairly easy, you just need a regular screwdriver and you'll have to cut the original wires for the fan and solder or twist on the ones from the replacement fan. I recommend using some heat-shrink tubing or electrical tape to cover the wires, too."

I did ask and received a 6 month extension on the warranty but the clock is ticking and it keeps breaking.  DO NOT buy this unit or anything from Kitchen Aid.  Their quality is awful."
B004ORS3B8,Maytag MDB7749AWB,Major Appliances,1,"Purchased this dishwasher in March 2014 and spend $660.  Used the sanitize option several times but after just a few months that stopped working.  We're now at August 2015 and we have to spend $300 to have the control panel replaced.  Turns out there is a problem with the control panel that causes corrosion and shorting out.  Not just this model but MANY other models as well.  Maytag is aware of this flaw but won't pay.<br />The morning we were leaving for vacation (July 29, 2015) I opened mid-cycle and when I hit start/resume, nothing happened.  Lights were flashing but nothing would start.  Called Maytag when we got back from vacation to inquire about replacement/repair options but they said their computers were down and couldn't help us.  Called another service place we found online to come look. After only 16 months, the control panel went out and we're now stuck paying $100 for labor and $200 for the part.  After reading more about this online, there are countless other complaints about this same issue.  An unbelievable amount of complaints for this same issue!  Check out the Consumer Affairs website.  Even discovered that there is a class action lawsuit against Maytag because of this design flaw.  Quality has seriously gone downhill since Whirlpool purchased them in 2005.<br />I purchased this from Home Depot but they no longer sell so I can't leave a review there.  I come to Amazon all the time for reviews so I decided to post here.  I want to make sure I get the word out to everyone I can about what a piece of junk this machine is.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!"

Stainless Steel Counter Depth Side-By-Side Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"This refrigerator seemed like it would be great....at first.  Within four months of purchasing the bottom shelf on door broke completely off. Okay well, we still had three more.  It has now been 11 months and the second shelf up has completely broken off.  Called &#34;Electrolux&#34; today and had to pull teeth to get information from customer service.  Cosmetics are not covered under the warranty and the bottom drawer cost $53.24 and the one above it cost $64.05.  If you were thinking about purchasing a sturdy fridge look elsewhere!!  Also the ice reservoir gets jammed and shoots out ice on the floor when it does so.  For $1300 you could do muchhhhhhhh better!  How about a free plastic shelf door for good customers who also bought the dishwasher and stove.  I guess customer service is not &#34; Electrolux's&#34; thing."

I have purchases many water dispenser before and this one beat the previous water dispensers that I've own. This is a top load and so the water bottle goes on the top rather from the bottle. I like the press-paddle design because it is much easier to get a cup of water. The one I have downstairs is a press button, which requires me to press down, and after 4 years of owning that water dispenser, the button occasionally gets stuck. When that happens I have to bang the side to get it from it stuck position.<br /><br />If you have little one, the child lock on the water dispenser is great. The press-paddle will not work alone if you want the hot water. You first have to press in the button and hold it in while pressing the paddle to get the hot water. I have check the temperature with my cooking thermometer and the cold water get to 47.8 degree F and the hot water is at 167 Degree F (super hot). With the cold water, it cold enough you don't need any ice. The hot water gets crazy hot and you can pretty much cooking ramen noddle, make tea, hot chocolate, and even coffee.<br /><br />*Received this product at a discounted price for an exchange for an honest review."

B00TLOVFU0,KITCHENAID FRENCH DOOR FRIDGE *BRAND SOURCE ONLY*,Major Appliances,1,"I should have known day 1 that this was a bad purchase. I bought this refrigerator at a very reputable appliance store. The day they delivered I noticed that 2 of the 3 doors had indentations in them. Not an obvious dent but if you looked at the doors the right way you could see large indentations in the metal and it was like that straight from the factory. The store said they would replace the doors no problem, only issue is that it took almost 6 weeks for Kitchen Aid to send them the new doors. Also on day one the cover for the meat draw did not fit at all and would not stay on. They ordered a new one of those too. Not what you would expect on an expensive refrigerator.<br /><br />When they came to replace the doors I noticed right away that the new freezer door had a similar indentation in the same spot but it wasn't as noticeable. The service technician told me it's almost impossible to get a door on one of these that does not at least have a slight indentation in that spot (bottom middle of the freezer door) so I just accepted it not wanting to go through the hassle again. He also had two new meat draw covers. Neither of them fit! The next step now was to order and replace the side rails for the draw. Weeks later they came and replaced the rails that the cover connects to and it still did not work. After several more weeks of waiting they came back with some plastic washers, disassembled the entire meat draw again and added the washers. The meat draw cover STILL does not work. You can barley get it on and then it pops off as soon as you pull the draw open.<br /><br />About a week later I opened the left door and the head of one of the screws in the bottom door hinge popped off which resulted in another service call to have the old screw drilled out and replaced with a new one.<br /><br />So 6 months since purchase I've had the dealer here (including the owner) probably 6 times and still do not have a working cover to the meat draw.<br /><br />I will never buy aKitchen Aid appliance again."

Love the double doors and I get tons of compliments on it.<br /><br />One note: I see a lot of reviews that relay the fridge doesn't get cool, etc....I had the same issue and got so annoyed! The solution: I moved it out from the wall about 1 or 2 inches....handled! Just like a regular fridge it needs space from the wall. Also, if you open the fridge door and contemplate what wine bottle to grab, it will lose all the cold and take awhile to cool back down. Makes sense because it's a small space. Just know what you are grabbing before opening....open and grab! Easy to handle.<br />This only got 4 stars because when I emailed the company regarding the fridge not getting cool (before I figured it out! I received zero response which is lame. Why wouldn't someone acknowledge and possibly trouble shoot like I managed to figure out?"

That is really fast.  Since I cook or my wife bakes almost everyday these features are essential for us and they have not disappointed in the slightest.<br /><br />I bought this range to replace a glass top electric range.

B00LH13UGM,LG LMXS30776S 30.0 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,5,"This is the best fridge I've ever owned.  The door in door is amazingly handy for milk and drinks, and with a family of six I don't have to worry about it being shoved in the back.  EVERYTHING is removable, making getting it really clean is a huge help when spills often happen daily.  We shop in bulk, obviously, and the double freezer doors are amazing.  I have bad fibro, so bending over is rough.  I keep all my handy freezer items in the top drawer, and the bottom holds pounds and pounds of frozen fruit and veggies.<br /><br />We had two refrigerators when we replaced one, and this holds everything the previous two do, allowing us to disconnect one except for large party planning.  That is a LOT for a family of six that only shops twice a week and eats a lot of fresh and frozen vegetables.

B004XQHBHC,"Samsung RF4289 28 Cubic Foot French Door Refrigerator with 4 Doors, Integrated Water & Ice, and,",Major Appliances,1,"Samsung builds JUNK!  Period.  I bought two appliances from Samsung.<br />This very expensive refrigerator which constantly buzzes so loud that it can be heard over my TV and a Convection Electric Range.<br />The stainless steel finish on both appliances are impossible to keep clean.  They can barely be touched without showing fingerprints.<br />In addition, both appliance arrived damaged; but this was impossible to see until after the boxes were opened.  The refrigerator has a base ball size dent on the right side and the range top arrived badly scratch. Samsung solely blamed the damage on the shipper, the shipper blamed it on Samsung.  Since the shipping boxes had no indication of any kind of breach or rough handling (in which case I would have refused delivery) I can come to no other conclusion other than Samsung being the culprit.<br />After having made a number of lengthy and fruitless phone calls I finally broke down and wrote them, only to be told again that this is not their responsibility.  Since I am a business owner and am very busy, I finally concluded I will simply have to live with it for now.<br />Samsung has one of the very WORST customer service department on the planet.<br />This is DEFINITELY the worst expenditure of $5,000.00 I have ever made."
B003O4FR2A,Samsung RF267AERS 26 cu. Ft. French Door Refrigerator - Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,1,"Excellent refrigerator looks and features. Unfortunately there is a SEVERE DESIGN FLAW in Samsung refrigerators. After owning and really enjoying after 4 years, we heard a loud grinding noise from the fan in the back of the refrigerator. Strangely, we noticed the Ice bucket was stuck too? So I googled the problem and found several folks had the same issues after owning from 1 year to several years down the road. The defroster section in the back of the refrigerator does not work properly and the fan motor and coils load up with ice. Ice also builds up in the ice bucket release and you cannot release the latch. You have to empty the refrigerator and thaw out all the ice. Unfortunately this is only a temporary fix since it continues. My heater element was fine, temp sensor fine, ice just keeps building up in the top section and plugs the fan. There was a class action law suit on this but Samsung refuses to help folks resolve their design flaw. I see mine has a heater to drain element added in the design from the earlier models, but that only helps with the lower half of the coils. Sad to spend so much on a fine looking fridge to have it be a lemon and not be supported by Samsung even though they know they have a bad design.<br /><br />Also, the spring for the door flap broke which seals the 2 French doors. It was cheap to fix, but Samsung used poor quality metal in the spring and it's a cheapo design that is not robust. So plan on fixing the door flap after about 2-3 years.<br /><br />I really want to like this refrigerator since the features are nice and it's a good layout. I like the LED. Most early reviews are favorable since they haven't had the defrost fail yet. So I thought I check in after 4 years and warn folks. Google this problem and you'll see. Samsung continues to use this faulty design as far as I can see, so BUYER BEWARE.<br /><br />I will not be buying any more Samsung devices. No more phone will be Apple after the S3 is done, no more Ovens, no more TVs, Samsung is a real fail."

B004FN4LKS,"Whirlpool Gold GU3200XTXY Fully Integrated Dishwasher, Silent Operation, Monochromatic Stainless St",Major Appliances,1,"We have had it for two and a half years now and it’s been nothing but problem after problem. First the handle on the silverware bin fell off within three months, no big deal right? Then a month after that the buttons on the touch panel start falling off. First the power button then the stop button and then the sanitize button. Ok so the finishes are junk at least it still works right? Well 8 months into it we had to replace the drain pump as it had cracked and was leaking when it would drain. Then a few months after that we had to replace the food chopping blade as a blade had broken thus causing more damage. A little while after that it starts making loud grinding noises again we have to replace parts. This has caused so much pain and the cost of ownership has made it we should have bought a $1200 dishwasher at least then we would have known what we were getting into. Almost forgot the plastic on the handle cracked and fell off about a year in.<br /><br /> This has sealed the deal for us no more Whirlpool, we tried the “GOLD” since it should have been better right. But we just paid more for a pile of junk, we just hope it makes it a few more months when we sell the house. Worst buy ever for us..!!!"

B00LOVVE9A,"SPT UF-304SS Energy Star Upright Freezer, 3.0 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,"There never seemed to be quite enough freezer space in my refrigerator. I sometimes threw away food for lack of space.<br />I did not want to buy a large freezer nor did I want to buy an extra full size refrigerator.<br />The size of this is perfect.  I like that it is upright and opens like a refrigerator rather than horizontal,<br />opening from the top.<br />There are 3 defined areas with baskets, which makes finding things a bit easier.  I do not know if it could be used without the baskets as the coils are right there; seems like not enough protection for the coils if items were placed directly on shelves.<br />There are no shelves on the inside of the door. That is fine with me, as it is not a large freezer and that feature would take away from shelf space in the main part of freezer.<br />I know that noise is a concern.  I don't notice it but the freezer is downstairs from my kitchen in the laundry room. I have never noticed more than a &#34;hum&#34; when next to it and it is running.<br />Delivery was very fast.<br />Two concerns prompted me to call customer support when it was delivered.<br />One concern, it is doubled packed with alert labels on the outer box to keep it upright. However, when I opened the outer carton I realized that the inner carton was upside down. Not good.<br />The other concern was I have heard that an appliance like this should not be plugged in right away. Unpack it, set it up but let it sit and settle for 24 hours.  Nowhere in the packaging was this mentioned.<br />I spoke to someone at customer support who was concerned that the freezer arrived upside down but assured me that if I had a problem they would take care of it.  He also said he would inform the shipping department. As it turned out I have not had a problem.<br />He also confirmed that I should not use it right away. He suggested 8 or so hours before plugging it in and starting it.  Maybe this is really common knowledge and I was just unaware. If it is important, seems it should be stated in packing material for those who like me are uninformed?<br /><br />I do wish it was self defrost but after a thorough search I had not seen a small freezer that was, maybe technology is just not there. So far, no need to defrost it after a month of use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a perfect solution to the not enough freezer space in the refrigerator problem.<br />I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this."

B000PKYXLC,Maytag MFI2568AES MFI2568AES Stainless French Door Refrigerator,Major Appliances,5,"I've had this refrigerator for more than 10years.  I love it.  It's he best refrigerator I have ever owned.  All of the bells n whistles work fine (ie, door chill, ice and water in door, adjustable and pull out shelves, deli drawer, etc) and I have never had to call anyone for repairs.  Nothing has ever broken.<br /><br />I only have 2 complaints.  One is the bottom shield (black plastic facade piece that hides front/feet).  It doensn't clip in very well and ends up just sitting on the floor in front.  It only bothers me when I mop and occasionally someone will kick it out of position.  My second complaint is that the wide &#34;deli drawer&#34; door (that flips up when you pull out the drawer) is very fragile.  I take it out to clean it and have to be very gentle.  I have not broken it only because I am extremely careful.  It is not very well designed for constant use and cleaning.  It should be far more durable."
B00UI16PA0,LG LFXS29626W 36&quot; 29 Cu. Ft. Capacity French Door Refrigerator with Slim SpacePlus Ice System Premium LED Interior Light SpillProtector Glass Shelves Tall Ice/Water Dispenser in Smooth,Major Appliances,5,"I had a very positive experience with this purchase.  It was delivered within 7 business days after the order was placed and arrived in perfect condition.  The LG refrigerators have the best ratings and I can see why.  I love the LED lighting and the well thought out design. One ice maker dispenses through the door for daily use with the option of ice plus which you can direct to an extra ice basket in the freezer for parties, etc.  The water dispenser area is taller than our old Samsung which leaked and caused the door to rust to which they took no responsibility.  The three vegetable/fruit drawers are nice for organizing and fit easily into the sink for cleaning.  The compressor is extremely quiet.  There are small condiment shelves on left door with larger bins on the right.  We did have to remove the doors and freezer drawer to get it into our house due to its size.  The instructions for this were not altogether clear, but there is a YouTube video by LG which clarified these concerns.  Please note the product description is for the entire shipping carton.  You can go to LG.com and get better specifications if space is an issue.  This is an excellent price as this refrigerator retails for about $2,800.  I would buy from this seller again."

The hose is the thinnest plastic went though like 4, After a while the seals leak(caulked it), my timer stopped working and the lint catcher had to be replaced to get it to stay in there before I ever used it. Another piece inside just fell off! Think I'll buy another brand next time. Not paying 25% of the cost on supposed warranty fees. Buyers be careful! Update: just threw it out a little over a year later because it stopped working and smelled like it was burning.Save your money!"

B005DUT1NE,Maytag MVWB950YW Bravos 4.6 Cu. Ft. White Top Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"I wish Amazon had negative ratings....<br /><br />Let me make it simple for you, DO NOT PURCHASE A MAYTAG product.  Maytag believes it's products should work for 1 year and then become obsolete, at least this is what the Maytag customer service line told me.<br /><br />I purchased a MVWB950YW (Bravos XL) top loader on September 4th, 2012 for $948.00 plus $99.00 for an extended warranty.  The washer worked marginally well when it was brand new.  June 2014, the washer in spin mode started to sound like a freight train was about to run through my house.  When I called for service the service company immediately signaled it was a bad bearing and offered me $500 to put towards a new or refurbished Maytag!!! They claimed if they were to repair the machine it would VOID the extended service contract????<br /><br />I wanted the washer fixed, I did not want to spend more money to buy a new machine.  I continued to use the machine as is, with the incredibly  loud noise.  June 2015, the same machine starts to leak water and is even louder.  Again the company in charge of the service contract offers money for me to put towards a new or refurbished machine.<br /><br />Net is, Maytag engineers it's products based on it's warranty - 1 year.  Anything after that they view as an opportunity to steal more money from you an I &#34;the consumer&#34;.  Do yourself a favor and NEVER purchase a Maytag product.  I would like to think American products are superior to it's foreign counterparts, however Maytag is not in this league.  In my opinion, Maytag has lost the privilege to call itself American and should no longer be allowed to do business in this country."

It takes work.  But when you wash in a tub with a rub board this is a fantastic improvement. Don't over fill for the amount of clothes you wash. To much water is not good makes a mess.

B00KY5V4M4,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine with Spin Dryer,Major Appliances,5,Does exactly what you want it too do. Fits a good amount of clothing (I would say a bit more than half of a normal washing machine) and cleans very well. The spin dryer is no joke either! Give your clothes a quick squeeze to get a bit of the water out and then throw them in the spin dryer for 3 to 5 minutes and your golden. We've set aside a part of the house where we can put the washer and hang our clothes to dry. We're saving tons of money by not going to the laundromat!<br /><br />Tips I've discovered:<br /><br />  *Make sure you give your clean clothes a quick squeeze before you throw them in the spin dryer. Just works better.<br />  *We use Tide and only need one cup per wash.<br />  *After washing the clothes we run them again with fresh water and softener. Same as the rinse cycle in a normal washer.<br /><br />The only con I would give would be the hoses. They work just fine but they're the typical plastic hoses that you know are going to break eventually. We're planning on buying proper rubber hoses with clamps to solve that problem before it happens. Also the built in lint catcher doesn't really work. Just pick up one of the floating lint traps for a couple bucks and you're good to go.

B001QFYDSI,Sharp Microwave Drawer Oven,Major Appliances,1,I had the microwave for about a year and a half - no problems until then. Then one day the microwave just started to smoke - with nothing in it and it wasn't turned on! I pulled the unit from under our kitchen island and carried it out - carefully as the back and side of the unit was extremely hot and the unit continued to smoke I waited for it to cool down and plugged it back in outside on the porch. The same thing happened. When I called customer service the first thing they asked me is if anything or anyone was hurt. I explained that no one was hurt but we were just fortunate that we happened to be home - if not the heat and smoke could have caused a fire. They then told me the unit was out of warranty. I replied that a year and a half product should not have done this no matter what the timeframe. They asked what I wanted done and I told them I wanted a replacement and they said they would call me back. I didn't hear from them for a week and when I called back they said the would call back with the name of an authorized dealer to get it fixed. A week later they told me that they couldn't do anything for me because it was out of warranty. I paid over $1000 for this piece of trash and Sharp had no concern for me as a customer and obviously do not stand behind their products or their brand.

B007VSU7DY,"GE GLDT690DWW 24"" White Fully Integrated Dishwasher - Energy Star",Major Appliances,2,"I am so disappointed with this product. I can't believe it is a GE. I had to replace our wonderful Asko after many years of good service. Because our counters are 1/2&#34; too low for standard height dishwashers and we live in a remote area, I had very limited choices available that I could buy online and I couldn't actually see it before I bought it. After one load, I can make only two positive points: 1) the unit fits under our counter, and 2) a reasonably gooey load of dishes did get clean and reasonably dry. The racks, rollers, utensil baskets and spray arms are made of flimsy plastic. Although the unit is the same size as the Asko, the racks are only 17&#34; deep (instead of 19&#34;). The top one only pulls out part way, reducing capacity and making it hard to load and unload. I don't know what &#34;fully integrated&#34; means. It does NOT mean quiet. After rattling and roaring on for nearly 2 hours on the first load, the wretched thing created a further commotion by flashing a whole string of green lights and making intermittent beeping sounds to celebrate the fact that it had completed its cycle.  This continued until I got up and manually turned it off. I'm glad it was happy, because I just wanted to cry. As for Square Trade, the jury is out. They promised &#34;same day&#34; shipping on July 19. It shipped on July 28 and finally arrived on August 4. The 3-year Square Trade Large Appliance Protection policy has yet to arrive. Somehow, I suspect I'm going to need it, although I might be happier just letting the thing die an early death. I would wait to write this review until I had more to report, but I've given myself only 48 hours to think about how annoying this dishwasher is before I pretend it just doesn't exist."
B000GZ2IAE,LG LFC25760ST 25 Cu. Ft. French Door Refrigerator with Glide N&apos; Serve Drawer &amp; Internal LED Touch Pad Digital Temperature Controls: Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,1,"I did not buy this refrigerator through Amazon.  I am just leaving this review for the product itself.  With that said, do not buy this refrigerator.  Like other reviewers stated, the light gets stuck on and you will not know why your milk and butter are warm until the plastic housing starts dripping onto your food or the toxic smell of burning plastic starts bothering your infants.  Once you have these faulty electronic circuits replaced and you buy a whole new motherboard and light housing, you could then look forward to the unit raising its internal temperature by itself as if someone is pushing the temperature raise button.  Don't worry though, this usually happens every time you open the fridge and you hear the beeps for every degree it is raising.  Simply push the temperature down button until you get to the required settings and then quickly close the door.  If the unit doesn't allow you to lower the temperature, simply close the door and come back later to try again.  Eventually the display, for both the fridge and freezer, will read &#34;off&#34;.<br />If you already own this model, I would replace the bulb with an led and immediately call LG for the replacement electronics and housing.  Also, to be on the safe side, I would pick up a fire extinguisher and keep it by your bed, change the batteries in your smoke alarms every six months, and make sure that you pay your house insurance on time."

Use very little detergent otherwise you'll be rinsing for a long time.  First&Best, the vendor was very helpful and pleasant to work with, resolved issue immediately once notified.  Would definitely buy through them again.  If the laundromat is a problem for you and space is an issue, give the Panda Small Compact Washing Machine a chance.  Whether line drying or using a dryer items dry quickly.  I would highly recommend this Panda.  And it's kind of fun.  Oh, I almost forgot to add the most important thing, it does clean your clothing extremely well.  I think it does a better job than my full size washer did. The only reason I did not give it 5-Stars is because I only received it a short time ago and haven't had an opportunity to use it enough yet."

B007XZ8FNO,LG Over-The-Range Microwave Oven with 300 CFM Venting System,Major Appliances,2,"Bought this 23 months ago and it works just fine till today. LG chat suggests the magnetron failed. The microwave appears to work but the food does not get hot and the turntable isn't turning. Another reviewer had the same problem and their technician replaced a faulty relay. I hope the fix is simple. For the last 23 months it works well but it is very loud with the vent fan on even on low as others commented. Also it would be nice to turn off the turntable which you can't. Lastly, there is no timer to time your baking cookies or dinner. Our oven has a timer but often it would be nice to have two timers. I wouldn't have even believed a kitchen appliance made would not have a timer. All in all, ok but loud. By the way, the fire issue was fixed in 2014."

It looks very nice and keeps a consistent temperature. The drawers are on guides/rollers, so come out much easier than others. I do wish they came out all the way though. The only challenge is the various sizes of wine bottles. Some are big enough in diameter to make placing them somewhat difficult. Overall very pleased with this though. Mine arrived with a bent front plate at the bottom. Titan was very responsive and had a replacement right out to me."
B001AXMGS0,Samsung : RFG297AARS 29 cu. ft. French-Door Refrigerator - Real Stainless,Major Appliances,1,"I bought this item.  It has had many problems.  I suspect I would rate it higher f the inevitable repair service from SEARS didn't take 1 month per visit and three weeks later coming back with the parts.  It has had Icemaker, Main board & compressor replaced at separate times.  We have had 5 service calls & repairs in the first 4 years we have owned it as a newer model from Samsung. Since all parts are made in South Korea you can imagine the lead time for anything special at the time we bought it.  Too many electronics to go wrong when mixing compression, refrigeration's & moisture as most modern refrigerators are.  My next purchase will be as simple as possible!  I am sitting her writing this message as I defrost the ice build up for about the 4th time as well.  Its an all day process.....STAY AWAY!!!!!"

So far it is excellent at getting the dishes clean.<br /><br />4hours later:<br /><br />Completed a sanitize wash of some cupcake pans.

B00T6OB50A,"Speed Queen AWN432SP 26"" Top Load Washer with 3.3 cu. ft. Capacity, in White",Major Appliances,5,"This Speed Queen washer works great!!!  It has a stainless steel drum with old fashioned dial controls (the less electronic stuff on a washing machine the less will go wrong).  It is a high efficiency machine (meaning less water usage); however, you can set the water manually by selecting a large load size to insure extra dirty clothes are cleaned well.  The annoying thing that most other folks who purchased this machine have noted is that water flow to the tub will shut off when you lift the lid.  There's no spinning or agitation going on so I don't understand why they would design it so that the tub won't fill with the lid up.  I bought Speed Queen because they are built well and last a long time.  My sister has one that is still going strong after 30 years of use."

B00CL4LXYA,Whynter UIM-501SS Stainless Steel Built-In Clear Ice Maker,Major Appliances,1,"First, this &#34;outdoor&#34; icemaker is only for use INDOORS as per the manual. Additionally, the ice compartment is NOT a freezer. This is not mentioned in the Amazon listing - it is only referenced in the manual. Thus, the ice compartment is always melting. The machine does not make cubes, it makes sheets of ice that is very difficult to break up. Finally, the first batches of ice sheets were almost black. Now after 6-8 rounds, the ice is light brown in color. I filed a claim with Amazon under their A to Z Guarantee to take this garbage away and refund my money since the seller wants to charge return shipping and a 15% restocking fee. Are you kidding me? This item should not even be permitted to be listed on Amazon. It is the biggest waste of money. No wonder it was only $1000 instead of $1900-$2400 like real outdoor icemakers.<br /><br />Finally, the ice is NOT clear. It is cloudy (yes I can tell with the light brown ice it makes). I have an ice maker in my kitchen built-in and the ice is crystal clear. I specifically bought this ice maker for my new outdoor kitchen."

It looks great, and being only a few inches taller & deeper than my prior cooler, has twice the capacity - such an efficient design.  I have around 110 bottles in with a mix of all varietals, sizes and shapes of 750s.  Still have room for a couple more cases easily.  The compressor is amazingly fast and quiet.  The cooler is in our living room and is no distraction at all.  I recommend purchasing through Wayfair, as their delivery options & services are more comprehensive.  Through Amazon, our only option was to have it dropped just inside the garage."
B003GX8M76,36 In. Gas Cooktop – Black,Major Appliances,3,"Purchased in April. Was easy to install, is easy to use and clean. The bad news is that it is difficult to fit enough pans on the stove to cook a meal. The big burner is in the middle.

It would be a 5 star washing machine but no spin cycle. You can drain most of the water out. But it needs to be high up to drain all of it out.

B00AW04ZMM,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine 7.9-15lbs with Spin Cycle …,Major Appliances,5,"Ok I am ready to review this little jewel.  I LOVE it.  Now I have to admit there were a few bumps in the road that I had to adjust to but once I got the hang of it, I LOVE this little machine. I ordered this unit for our motor home that did not come equipped with a washer/dryer.  I detest spending time and money at a laundry mat while on vacation (or any time for that matter) so I figured this little unit would pay for itself in no time.  I am right.<br />It took three loads to get the hang of what I needed to do.  I flooded the bathroom floor twice and soaked a rug sitting under the unit once before I got everything under control.  My problem was the drain-out hose.  I had to try different positions before finding the one that allowed the tub to drain out without causing the hose to pull out of the sink and fall to the floor.  After the minor bumps, I got it right with no problems.  The clothes washed very quickly, rinsed without problems and the spin side got rid of most of the water.  I am happy with this product and it will be used many, many times as we travel the country."

B00CG51KNS,LG Graphite 5.1 Cu Ft Front Load Steam Washer and 9.0 Cu Ft Steam Electric Dryer set with Pedestals WM8000HVA DLEX8000V WDP5V,Major Appliances,5,"Only had these for a month and Love them.  We had a smaller frontloader set before this. we have a Great Dane and haft to wash alot of covers weekly for inside house.  This extra capacity makes all the difference in the world.  Also we have noticed small or large loads are just as clean if not cleaner.  We barely use any soap as well.  Between the spin cycle and the driyer the time to dry is like half of our old set.  really fast.  We used to haft to use the timed dry on our old set, on this one we are able to use all automatic operations and it works perfectly.<br />Just a personal note<br />if you don't have some strong young or older men to help you get this on the pedestools you may want to concider paying a appliane man or someone to install them. Getting these on the Pedistools was not easy and these wieght a ton. Be  careful moving into place I used my knee and it ended up barely pushing in the stainless steele where  my knee pushed it. I pretty much followed the directions on ballancing then I marked off with permeninent marker where pedistools go.  Just make sure you keep track of each one because they are twins.<br /><br />Update as of 2-20-17<br />We still love them literally no complaints what so ever. As to doors opening I think after owning this long without that happening I'd haft to assume operator error. We wash Great Dane blankets 3 (full size comforter) weekly and it's never had one issue in nearly 3 years of daily use. It gets everythin super clean and the steam option is really great especially with dog bedding."
B007OK6DGO,Appliance Art 11383 Appliance Art Breaking Up Dishwasher Cover,Major Appliances,5,"This is such an inventive idea. High quality, great fun. I bought two separte but similar covers for my apartment washer and dryer. I cut the door and handle out with an exacto knife. This is an old set Kenmore set (20 years old-unfortunatley not made anymore) that is the same size as a built-in dishwasher. Gave them a new life."
B000WO5892,Sunpentown IM-150US Stainless Steel Undercounter Ice Maker with Freezer,Major Appliances,4,The ice maker works as it should. Makes half moon ice cubes. Filled the ice bucket in one day after I had dumped two half buckets for cleaning.<br />I took one star off for the noise volume the machine makes while it makes ice. Do not install the ice maker where sound would be a problem. When the ice bucket is full it runs only enough to keep the ice in the bucket solid. I did not experience the water leaking as noted by other reviews.

B00CDWTQKI,"The Laundry Alternative Nina Soft Spin Dryer, Ventless Portable Electric Dryer. 3 Year Warranty, 127V, 60 Hz",Major Appliances,5,I ordered this portable Spin Dry to use in our motor home that did not come with a washer dryer installed.  I do not like spending money in a laundry mat on vacation and I thought this little unit would be perfect for our needs.  It did what I wanted  BUT I still had to take the clothes to the laundry to finish drying them.  The good news though is--it took only about 45 minutes to completely dry three loads of clothes in one dryer.  Just a few minutes for each load was all that was needed.  I can live with that.  I know I will get many years of use from this small portable spin dryer.

B001NPRIIS,Broan 30W in. E Series Under Cabinet Range Hood,Major Appliances,5,"I live in a small condo.  Previous to purchasing this hood we only had the blower in the over-the-stove microwave.  Decided to go with this hood for our remodel.  Prior to switching to a hood our smoke alarm would go off constantly even if there was a breath of smoke in the air.  The alarm has not gone off at all since installing this hood and matching recirc kit.  I highly recommend it.  There are a lot of complaints about the sound level of this hood.  I have not had the same experience.  In fact, it's much more quiet than the microwave fan it replaced and a gazillion times more effective."
B00IRNRXUC,"Samsung WA56H9000AP Energy Star 5.6 Cu. Ft. Top-Load Steam Washer with EZ Reach Design, Platinum",Major Appliances,5,"The most amazing washer I have ever owned. Spacious, easy to use, and does a great job! We researched for quite awhile, went to many appliance stores, and this without a doubt is the best choice on the market with it's sleek looks, amazing quality and ease of use. Has lovely tones that go off when your load is starting a new function and when the load is done. Washer lid locks when the load starts, but easy to pause and it will click open if you need to add something you forgot. I prefer to use laundry pac soaps dropped directly in the tub as keeps the washer cleaner, but you can use liquids and powders as well in special drawer type cups. Also has a cup for bleach. LOVE the &#34;bedding&#34; selection for blankets, sheets, even pillows. The nice big stainless tub is gorgeous! I know, I know, it's just a washer, but I am so proud of this washer!"
B002MPLYEW,"Danby 120 Can Beverage Center, Stainless Steel DBC120BLS",Major Appliances,1,"I purchased this for patients/customers in my office in June 2015.  It came with a minor dent in it, which I overlooked because I didn't want to hassle with a return.  Then I couldn't figure out how to level it because the one adjustment foot provided was too high even on the most screwed-in position.  There were bigger fish to fry, so I set it aside until today (August 2015).  I went to see what I could do to fix the leveling and turned it on it's side to find that one corner was crushed inward!  This was disconcerting to say the least.  The leg in that corner won't touch the ground, hence the lack of leveling.  More disconcerting, however, is that I saw residue on the underside from some sort of past leakage!<br /><br />I purchased this product &#34;new&#34; and have never even plugged it in, so where on earth did that sticky leakage residue come from.  Couple that with the smashed corner and it appears I was sold a USED product as NEW.  I am now past the return window and apparently just flushed $200 down the toilet!!  IRATE is an understatement.  Do not buy this product from Amazon if you want a new cooler.  Passing off used, damaged equipment as new is unethical."

B004I04BWQ,LG LSMH207STStudio 2.0 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Over-the-Range Microwave,Major Appliances,4,"Only caveat is that this is an older model but is not here priced accordinglyl; new LG Extend-a-Vent is a 2.2 cu ft model with touch pad moved to the right. (We just got ours--manufactured April, 2010--as a floor model for $400 including installation.) That being said, the model has many features that still make it worthy of buying.<br /><br />BIG PROS:<br />*UNLIKE ALL OTHER MICRO HOODS, when the 400 CFM Extenda Vent is pulled out, it extends to 19&#34; with 2 extra filters, covering nearly all of your range's front burners. (It has 2 other 6&#34; x 7&#34; mesh filters in the main part of the vent unit.) Vent will run without front pulled out. The 2 front filters must be unscrewed to take them out; the back two slide out. Filters cannot be washed in the dishwasher.<br />*WARMING function uses RADIANT (not microwave) HEAT and can be set at 200, 170, 140, or 100 degrees. Besides keeping dishes and even turkeys warm (even in metal pans and covered with aluminum foil!) this means you can dry herbs at 140 or 170 degrees AND raise (proof) your own yeast breads at 100 degrees!!!<br />*DIGITAL DISPLAY PROMPTS tell you at every step what to do if you forget for, say, multi-stage cooking, defrost cycles, sensor cook for potato vs vegetables, etc.<br />*SOFTENING function perfect for butter, cream cheese, etc.<br />*MELTING function great for chocolate, butter, etc.<br />*CUSTOM functions lets you turn the beep and/or clock off, set 3 levels of scroll speed, and change between lbs and kg.<br /><br />CONS:<br />*Can't use TURBO (boost) setting for vent when also using microwave, only Hi or Low.<br />*Has 3 INCREDIBLY INSULTING &#34;Kids Meals&#34; buttons for &#34;Mac&Cheese,&#34; &#34;Hotdog&#34; and &#34;Chicken Nuggets&#34; preprogramed for specific amounts that vary cooking time from 40&#34; for 2 hotdogs to 2'40&#34; for 8 oz chicken or 12 oz mac&cheese.<br />*Miss the Express Cook function I had on my GE microwave where I pressed &#34;1&#34; for 1 minute cooking, &#34;2&#34; for 2 minutes, and so on, but that required I use a &#34;TimeCook&#34; button before programming each custom cook time, so I guess it's a fair trade off."

I am a refrigeration  tech that drives 800-1000 miles a week. This cooler let's me pack my lunch and carry some snacks and drinks with me. The reason the cooler is so expensive is because they have managed to cram an entire refrigeration system into a tiny package. Those cheap thermo electric coolers don't compare to this thing at all. If you are going to travel a lot you should also purchase the transit bag which adds insulation to the body of the cooler and the slide lock which allows you to mount the cooler to the floor.<br /><br />Pros<br /> Cooler works great in all ambient temps<br /> Uses very little power<br /> Cools down to temp within 30 minutes<br /> Keeps food dry, unlike a traditional ice cooler<br /> Can operate as a fridge or freezer<br /> No need to deal with packing ice<br /><br />Cons<br /> Expensive<br /> Very primitive temp control<br /> The cooler is fairly quiet but the swing compressor design causes it to make a deep compressor note so on a quiet night you can hear it running outside your vehicle. It's not loud at all but since it's such a deep tone it's kind of a unique sound."

Do you enjoy colonoscopies without sedation? If yes to either question Then by George an LG Washing Machine would be right for you!<br />I had been tickled pink by my LG washer & dryer set for about 2 years. Until said washing machine flooded our townhouse whilst I was running it's Tub Clean cycle. If you own an LG washing machine, by the way, you will get to know that Tub Clean cycle Rather well as the unit constantly smells of rotting eggs. Anyway, this particular morning the washing machine decided to spew forth a torrential downpour that caused it to rain through the 2nd floor laundry area into our ground floor foyer/garage area. Did I mention the ankle deep river with a current that was our upstairs hallway?!? I probably should reference that... Even with the almost immediate shut off of all water to the house, the impact was significant.  All in all: about $14000 worth of damages to the home.<br />LG customer service has been horrific. They continued to reference the event as a &#34;leak&#34; despite my repeated efforts to semantically clarify the incident. LG has taken the stance that as the unit was out of warranty, they &#34;can not be responsuble&#34; for its malfunction or ensuing damages. They have refused to pay for/ assist with our homeowners deductible  &  even charged me over $200 for a &#34;service visit&#34; for repairs to the machine wherein I was told there appeared to be nothing wrong with the unit. Moreover, I &#34;shouldn't worry&#34; about using it in the future. He changed an overflow valve Anyway even though it did not appear to be damaged. Oookkkkaayyy. I feel super confident now with my sparkly front load LG tsunami maker because DUH, I Shouldn't Worry, right?!? Besides, LG stands by the &#34;repair&#34; for 90 days.<br /><br />So YES, if you like living dangerously & want a major appliance within your household to be manufactured  by a company that behaves in a manner consistent with a sociopath, then splurge & get this LG Washing Machine."

B00EQC3D3O,Professional-Grade Ozone Ionic Laundry Purifier,Major Appliances,2,"The first instructions I got for installing the WashIt told me I could install it myself. The instructions I finally got with the package recommended a professional install it. He was crabby about the product's &#34;Mickey Mouse&#34; construction, which I ignored because I was so excited about the prospect of simplifying my laundering processes and saving water (we're in California). However, big questions arose immediately about use that the enclosed booklet left completely unanswered: 1) there is no on/off switch, a very strange design flaw; 2) when the device remains on, it emits a high-pitched noise, painful to some but to me, sounds like the device is sizzling; 3) we have to unplug the device every time we use it. If the switch on the bottom side is meant to be an off/on button, it doesn't work; 4) there is no product-supplied cap for the hot water inside the unit; 5) I registered the product twice online since receiving it July 29 and had an automatic response to let me know there'd be an acknowledgment in 1-2 business days. Still waiting. The first few loads of laundry came clean, almost dry and absolutely wrinkle-free. That has already diminished, with this morning's load very wet and questionable, as far as clean goes. Not getting vital questions about use answered and already seeing failure of function. Maybe it is too good to be true."

He states in a hostile voice &#34; what do you expect?  It's made in China&#34; . I guess I expect a quality product for a quality price. So finally he gives a third company to call which was a comany I spoke with three weeks prior. They never put a work order in.

In fact, if at its highest setting of 7, it can freeze food/drink in the center area, mostly on the bottom at the back. I had to put it down to 6 to avoid this. I did not understand the issue other customers had with the interior light; sure you have to reach in to shut it off, but it's a glass-front door so it is designed to have contents on display. I leave the light on all the time. I have this is my office and I pretty much never notice the noise. I had a Haier fridge (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GWT8OW?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00) which lasted 2.5 years, but so far this Whynter one is better looking and colder. If the Whynter one lasts as long or longer, I'll be very happy."

I cannot find a customer service number and I really don't know if I have to pay for return shipping or how it works this is a little bit confusing but the machine does seem to wash clothes well and the rest of the reviews are correct  as far as washing and spinning. I'm still deciding whether I should return the unit and try another one. When I received the unit on Sunday it seemed like I received a refurbished model because it had some stains/residue in the tub."

The bottom draw always has issues sliding back in; I have to lift it up most of the time and place it in the dishwasher. The top draw seems cheaply made---one of the two raise/lower mechanisms breaks apart and the draw dips/falls on one side. I can generally put it back in but it's not very stable. The soap door occasionally doesn't open; not sure if something was blocking it but I generally don't pack it full enough for that to occur. I like Samsung TVs, but as far as dishwashers go they missed a few spots!"

Nice set overall with many great features. Much larger than expected. Looks like a flat face in the photo, but more of a bubble. Doors purposefully swing open, so be careful. Mounting the dryer on pedestal was a bit of a challenge, but very much worth it. Can't wait to explore the many great features!"
B005GYKDVG,"Avanti IM12-IS Portable Countertop Ice maker, Platinum",Major Appliances,1,just over 1 month after purchase it makes so much noise that it sounds like a Jet taking off.... but beyond the 1 month return window so I am stuck with this piece of crap.......
B005R597HA,Avanti 110-Volt Automatic Portable Compact Dryer with Stainless Drum and See-Thru Window,Major Appliances,3,"Had to get a replacement the replacement is here, and I'm not sure if it overheats and turns off to protect itself, but sometimes I'll go to check my laundry after a 200 minute cycle is started, and it will be stopped on the 60 minute mark, and I can't make it turn back on unless I cycle it from the off position back on.<br /><br />PRICE: I bought this dryer when it was on sale for $286.99 with prime shipping. So the fact at the time of writing this review the price is at 394.51 with free shipping is INSANE! So if the price doesn't drop go buy a Sonya at http://amzn.to/1HM4D2V in retrospect I think they got a larger capacity in the Sonya.<br /><br />FIRST CONTACT: This arrived is perfect shape, no dents, no nothing. At first it did make a slightly weird sound, but it resolved itself right away (maybe the belt was slightly off?) Anyway it heats up very well, but ventilation is kind of tricky (if your not very hands on). The back vent is just a circle extruded out, and it comes with the oval shaped exhaust vent which I personally found to be 100% useless.<br /><br />THE EXHAUST: The circular exhaust doesn't stick out much so it was kind of difficult for me to zip tie a hose to it, but I managed to do it, and it works great. You must find some way to expel the exhaust otherwise the dryer will suck the moisture back in from the front intake vent, and yeah your cloths will never dry this way.<br /><br />BUTTON LOCATIONS: Okay so this is kind of annoying, but I guess its whatever. The heat knob is located in the bottom right which means you need to pretty much be on the floor when turning the dial. The button to the left of this the one you press allows you to switch from automatic heat or timed heat. Personally timed heat I think works best, but the auto is good to save energy since the unit has a built in moisture sensor you just turn the dial knob all the way up to 200 minutes with the button depressed, and it will start auto drying.<br /><br />CAPACITY: I would say it has plenty. If your doing blankets you got to do one at a time if they are king size since they will pretty much take up the whole dryer.<br /><br />LINT FILTER: The filter is located in center of the drum you just reach in and pull is straight towards you and it will pop out. It will feel like your going to great it, but trust me you won't. When they say clean the filter they mean clean the dang filter. If you don't keep up with the filter you will be 100% disappointed with this dryer. If you clean it before every load, or after every load than you will be a happy camper.<br /><br />SHIPPING: When the FedEx guy came to the front, and slammed it down (not literally, but it was a light drop). I was concerned about how it would perform after some rough shipping. It preformed great, and was packaged well (I thought it was anyway).<br /><br />Quality of drying a normal load: Simply put it dryers 1-2 loads of very well, but keep up with the filter, and make sure it is proper ventilated.<br /><br />REASON FOR 4 STARS: Button location - Okay so if you got this on the Avanti stand that allows you to have it up in the air than the button location probably is not a problem, and the fact that they are on the bottom would be of benefit. However for me I got it in the floor, and I have to cough all the way down to get a good look at the knob to turn the dial to the appropriate time for drying.one at a time if they are king size since they will pretty much take up the whole dryer.

Needless to say, it made me want to purchase the extended warranty through Samsung.  Flashforward to two-1/2 years later, and I have spent 4 days tracking down my extended warranty.  I've called at least 4 different Samsung warranty numbers who could not find it.  A supervisor finally found it in about two seconds and said the other customer service reps didn't know where to look.<br /><br />However, the service center called me and said I needed to talk w/ Samsung as they didn't provide service on my Samsung warranty.  Another call to a supervisor found that my insurance purchased through Samsung was sold to a third party, and now I'm on hold with them for over an hour, waiting my &#34;turn&#34;.  Now, they are asking for the original receipt as well as the warranty number and serial number.<br /><br />This is a major scam.

Installation was very easy and fit perfectly into the space formerly occupied by a 1989-era range hood that just filtered the air and returned it to the kitchen.  This Broan, which we connected to a chimney via an existing pipe, is powerful and relatively quiet.  For us, it was the perfect balance between performance and price (USD_315.).  Although totally unnecessary, we particularly like the &#34;theater lighting&#34; feature which brightens and dims the lights slowly."

Now it won't run at all, won't reset at all. Have had two different repair companies by to look at it and they both told me to buy a new washer. Disappointing.

B001IMTWZS,Viking VDSC5304BSS 30 Professional Series Dual Fuel Range,Major Appliances,1,The Viking range we bought was damaged since we bought it and was very dangerous.  It was very lucky that is didn't severely hurt someone.  The outside would heat up to 400 to 500 degrees which could have caused severe burns.  This could be confirmed by the service technicians that Viking referred.  They techs also said there was nothing we could have done to damage the range.  The only reason that Viking service manager came out was because Viking was non responsive to the situation and we were going on over 8 months to get the range finally fixed.  It should be Vikings responsibility to take care of a dangerous product caused by the manufacture and offer good service for such an expensive of product.  Since Viking has decided to offer such horrible customer service and take any responsibility I have made it my mission to write reviews almost everywhere on the company of my experience online and tell just about anyone about my bad experience with Viking.  I have already taken to over 10 people that have also had a bad experience with Viking.  I don't know how a business can continue to stay in business with the way they treat their customers.

B00UXOIL04,Eclean Portable Compact Twin Tub Washing Machine 7lbs Washing Capacity Ean152,Major Appliances,5,"I bought the exact same washer/dryer unit around 4-5 years ago, it just had different branding. It died on Tuesday and I had this one delivered to my front door Thursday morning. The one I had, the dryer stopped working right after a year. Some things you can fix yourself - it's not that complex of a washer/dryer, but after emailing back and forth with the seller we realized it wasn't something simple. I hardly just wanted to toss the unit so I kept using the washer part for several years and I would just ring out my clothes. It was a pretty good little washer. But Tuesday I had run it for hours, there was a lot of laundry. I finally finished my last load and the machine was off. I was sitting in the living room when I heard a funny noise in the kitchen. I got up to go see what it was and walked in just in time to see sparks shoot out the back. In the outlet I just had plugged in the washer/dryer and microwave. Neither one were running at the time. I quickly pulled both cords out and it blew that breaker. Smoke was coming from my machine. Luckily it's so lightweight I could easily drag it outside. Even after it sat out there for an hour, the machine still had a kind of burning electrical smell. I carried it out to the dumpster and that was that.<br /><br />I got on Amazon and started shopping and even after all that, I still love this style of washer/dryer. Many people have them and if my experience was indicative of this machine, there would be more people talking about it. It could happen with any appliance - and I did work this washer hard on a regular basis. It gave me a lot of good use and I enjoyed having it. When I found this listing, I knew it was the one. The seller got it here super-fast and I got to test this one out last night. While it looks the same, it ran different but better. The agitation is much stronger. I put the same amount of soap in the first load but the suds went all crazy. It was full of suds. I had to scoop them out then run it again after filling only with cold water. I'll use about 1/4 of the detergent in this one than what I used in the old one. I also lifted up the lid while it was washing and holy heck, it really was moving everything around a lot. They may have improved upon this washer in the last few years. I also tested out the dryer. On my old one, it seemed that plastic insert thing would frequently get off balanced (when it was still working). I was almost afraid to test it, to ruin the &#34;magic&#34; because I was so happy about having a washer. Upon testing it, it stayed balanced and squeezed all the moisture out. So far, I'm pretty thrilled!<br /><br />Update: I just wanted to come back real quick to say I'm still loving this washer/dryer combo! My clothes are much cleaner. Also, I noticed there is this lip going around the top of the spin/dry barrel I hadn't seen in my last unit. It makes it less likely the plastic insert would come out by accident.

B00AW04ZMM,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine 7.9-15lbs with Spin Cycle …,Major Appliances,1,"I bought this portable washing machine so I wouldn't have to leave my apartment and lug my laundry to the washing machines in the basement of my building. I read great reviews but am disappointed after using the machine. It's just too much work for washing 2 or 3 pieces of clothing at a time. The washing cycle is max 15 mins long which isn't enough sometimes. And there are so many soap suds in the clothes after draining a washing cycle, that I either have to take out the clothes and rinse them in the sink by hand before putting them in the spin dryer, or I have to repeat the washing cycle 2 or 3 times after draining the first cycle to rinse all the soap out of the clothes. And then the clothes have to transferred out of the washing bin into the spinning bin. And then after spinning they have to be hung up to dry or put in a separate dryer machine. A narrow undetachable u-shaped hook is fit on the draining pipe which adds an unnecessary kink to it and slows it's drainage. Plus the hook is so narrow it won't fit over my bathtub, bathroom sink or kitchen sink. When I turn on the drain, the water gushes out the drain pipe so fast that the drain pipe will jump out of the bathtub and onto the floor (making an awful mess) unless I place something heavy on the drain pipe to keep it in place. Overall too much hassle. I still use it to wash small items that I don't want to mix with a load of laundry, like a new shirt that may wash out a lot of color, or when i need to wash one item without waiting to gather a load. But otherwise I have gone back to gathering loads of laundry over weeks and hauling it to the public machines."

After reading several reviews I settled on this one. It has not disappointed at all. It's great quality and quiet. I have not had any problems with the freezer leaking water or any other common mini fridge problems. I also love that you can use magnets on this fridge as a lot of new refrigerators don't have that anymore. You can fit a ton of stuff in here. I put half a gallon of milk, tons of drinks, and still have room for food. There is a drawer and a removable shelf. Stop looking at other refrigerators and get this one. It's worth it!"

We used this product as directed and right afterward our 12-year old Frigidaire front-loading washing machine sprung an internal leak. Cause and effect? We think so.

Our trusted appliance repairman quoted us $175 to fix our machine, so we decided to buy a new one instead."

Amazon should stop this seller from selling it.  It is very dangerous product. There is nothing support underneath the glass.  Basically, you cook on a thin piece of glass.

B00C9YTN08,"Frigidaire FGHB2866 Frigidaire Gallery 27.8 Cu. Ft. French Door Refrigerator,",Major Appliances,1,"We bought this product from an appliance store in December 2014 and have already had problems with it twice.  Two months after buying it, it stopped cooling the top portion and the displayed temperature would intermittently go from 33 degrees to 60 degrees back and forth.  We verified with a refrigerator thermometer that the temperature inside was over 40 most of the time.  Luckily, we kept the old refrigerator in the garage that works 10x better even though it's antiquated.  The inside led lights have not worked either since we bought it.  We are almost out of warranty and I fear that we will have to spend another close to $2000 on something that doesn't work.  I would stay away from Frigidaire/Electrolux products as the company doesn't stand by its products and I can see why.  I have added my information to a website calling for a class action lawsuit on these products along with some GE as well.  Hopefully, we can be compensated for our troubles."

B00G23MKL6,Whynter Energy Star Upright Freezer,Major Appliances,5,"I received this freezer a few days ago to use for freezing pumped breast milk as our primary freezer was overflowing.  This freezer is the perfect size to sit in our garage and use for storage purpose - although the appeal of the design warrants that it could be placed elsewhere in our home.<br /><br />The seal on the door is fanstastic and unlike the seal on our refrigerator / freezer combo.  It almost borderlines on too tough to open, but I do know the items will stay frozen well this way.<br /><br />As soon as we plugged it in, we tested it to see how long it would take to freeze some water and it happened within a couple hours.<br /><br />So far, I am very pleased with the design, space and overall value this freezer is for the price.  I highly recommend it."

B001VMGVXQ,SAMSUNG DC97-07448D ASSEMBLY-FIXER TUB FRONT OEM Original Part,Major Appliances,5,"I didn't even know I needed these until a moving company told me about them.  The installers did not leave them when the took them out.<br /><br />For my washer WF350ANW/XAA there are four large keyhole looking holes where these bolts need to be inserted.  You may have gray covers that you need to pop off.  The bolts themselves must end up going through the small key portion of the hole to be aligned properly, and not centered in the large part of the hole like I initially thought.  If you shine a flashlight into the holes you'll notice the threaded holes in the drub are centered on the small part of the keyhole, and not the large.<br /><br />It's helpful to pull the bolt out of the large white housing until only 1/2&#34; or so of the tip is protruding.  Then slide the whole thing into the large hole taking care to aim the tip at the threaded hole in the drum.  You need to push the white housing all the way in past the outside keyhole then slip the bolt into the small part of the keyhole.  You may have to push the white housing a bit hard to push the drum back so it goes past the outside keyhole.  At this point the tip of the bolt should be in the threaded hole in the drum, the washer and cable bracket will be outside of the keyhole, and you can begin screwing in the bolt until tight.<br /><br />If you have trouble seeing what you are doing you can remove the top cover of the washer by unscrewing the two 10mm bolts on the back of the top cover.  This will allow you to see where you are putting the bolts on the inside.<br /><br />My guess is the bad review had the same problem I initially did thinking the bolts had to be centered in the large part of the keyhole."

B00PR0T0L8,Titan TT-CBC1580SZ 80-Can Beverage Cooler SEAMLESS Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,4,"Works well so far. I've had it for about a week, but it does keep the beverages nice and cold. I did let it sit for a day before installing and let it get down to temperature before putting anything in it. It also has plenty of ventilation, as required, which leaves a big gaping hole above the unit when installed under the cabinet. I only have it about half full. Don't know if it will or will not work as well if packed full. One weird thing is that when the door is &#34;locked&#34; it still has about a half inch of movement in the door. So even in the locked position, the door could potentially be ajar. I thought it should lock more tightly."
B00471MQ14,Whirlpool WTW4950XW 3.6 Cu. Ft. White Top Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"We purchased this washer 7 months ago when our old washer was on its last legs.  I'm not pleased at all with this Whirlpool machine.  Of course, (1) the locking lid feature is just a pain in the neck!  (2) I also, don't like the idea of putting the dry clothes on the dry detergent.  In my old washer, I added a small amount of water, then dissolved the detergent prior to adding the clothes and starting the machine. (3) Then the &#34;low-washer&#34; feature seems to be a joke, as it should be called, &#34;not enough water&#34;.  It takes FOREVER tomplete a wash cycle.  Often, the dark clothes have white marks from the detergent, the clothes are not clean, and they really don't smell clean at all. (4)  It takes FOREVER to complete a wash cycle.<br />So....I'm trying to figure out a way to trick this machine into using enough water to actually wash the clothes.  I've read all the reviews I could find.  So far, it looks like I can keep the control on &#34;bulky items&#34;, which will add a little more water to the tub.  I've also put the control on  extra rinse, as I feel like a little extra water added in an extra rinse might help get out the soap residue.  One review suggested soaking the clothes before putting them in the tub; that the extra weight would cause the machine to add additional water.  Has anyone tried this? I'm wondering if this might work, even though it sounds like a pain to do.  The Whirlpool guide specifically says to NOT add additional water to the tub, but I'm wondering if that actually might work.<br />Has anyone found a way to make this machine actually work, as I can't afford to just throw it away and get a new machine.  At this point, I'm definitely NOT a Whirlpool fan."

B0063E2HTE,EdgeStar 34 Bottle Wine Cooler with Compressor - Freestanding,Major Appliances,5,"I really don't understand all of the negative comments about this product.  I read many of the reviews before I purchased this and to be totally honest, here was my experience.<br />- to begin with, it was shipped via FEDEX and it arrived 4 days after I ordered it.  I did not ask for expedited shipment.<br />- the shipping container was a container within a container so you can tell there was special care placed in ensuring the product got there safely and without and possibility of damage.  I was very surprised to see the size of the box when it arrived and I thought at first that this was way larger than I anticipated.  However, it was because after I opened the outside box (which had padding to protect the inside box) there was another box inside with the actual product also padded completely.<br />- I REALLY don't understand the noise complaints at all.  In fact when I first turned it on, I thought the thing was not working but as it turned out the device is extremely quiet and you literally have to put your ear next to the cooling motor to hear it. This is by far the quietest wine cooler I have owned.<br />- the temperature does fluctuate slightly but this is normal.  Never more than two degrees up or down and the fan that exists inside the cooler keeps the entire upper and lower sections completely even.<br />- all of my bottles fit extremely well.  I like the fact that the racks are tilted slightly and it is very easy to store and retrieve the wine.<br />- great product and strongly recommend it."

B00VVH5XY4,"Samsung NE59J7630SW 30"" White Electric Range",Major Appliances,1,"Purchased from Home Depot, and within four hours, knew we did not want this range! This Samsung NE59J7630 in white was installed in my home while I was away today. When I came home, the first thing I noticed is that the stove was a full 3&#34; away from the wall. Our 240v outlet in dead center, at the back wall of the 30&#34; space. The last two stoves had a recess underneath so that the stove slid right over the outlet, and there was plenty of room for the large 6' power cord. This Samsung has no recess at all in the middle-rear of the stove, and not much recess to the sides. So, not sure what could be done, short of spending a few hundred $ for an electrician (not going to happen). The second, and very major flaw, so far... is the oven. I hung three, collaborated oven thermometers in the middle of the oven. I then programmed the oven to regular bake for 55 minutes at 450 degrees. At 15 minutes, the oven display finally indicated that it had reached 450 degrees. But in fact, it had not! The the actual temp in the oven was only 350 degrees; and it took a full 30 minutes for the oven temp to reach an accurate 450 degrees! This thing is going back to whence it came!"
B00F3VMIKQ,GE GTR10GBEWW 9.9 Cu. Ft. White Top Freezer Refrigerator,Major Appliances,1,I had a GE 9.9cu previously that was just fine - kept food cold - did what it was designed to do. After 17 years it finally broke down - and I decided to replace it with this new model.  What a mistake I made. Just dreadful Every 2-3 weeks- or whenever the mood strikes it - it decides to defrost itself.  The first time it happened - I thought it was defective - until I found out that this is normal for this model.  Everything in the freezer defrosts to room temperature.  The refrigerator compartment becomes warm.  I have to throw out food constantly. There is NO way to control this.  I have tried lowering settings - nothing can override defrost cycle. Buyer beware - KEEP away!

B00U7XJ22C,Samsung WA52J8700AP 5.2 Cu. Ft. PlatinumTop Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"HEADS UP THEY CAN EXPLODE.  MINE HAS NOT, BUT SERIAL NUMBER IS AN AFFECTED ONE.  The most amazing washer I have ever owned.  Spacious, easy to use, and does a great job!  We researched for quite awhile, went to many appliance stores, and this without a doubt is the best choice on the market with it's sleek looks, amazing quality and ease of use. You will need to get used to a new way of doing laundry, but once you learn all the functions, and how the washer works, (leave it alone, it knows what its doing..) you are going to be happy you made this choice like I was.  I will suggest to buy the warranty on the washer even if you are not a warranty person.  Skip the warranty on the dryer, it is an uncomplicated appliance but the washer needs a warranty as far more complicated to repair and more expensive. Has lovely tones that go off when your load is starting a new function and when the load is done. Washer lid locks when the load starts, but easy to pause and it will click open if you need to add something you forgot.  I prefer to use laundry pac soaps dropped directly in the tub as keeps the washer cleaner, but you can use liquids and powders as well in special drawer type cups. Also has a cup for bleach.  LOVE the &quot;bedding&quot; selection for blankets, sheets, even pillows.  The nice big stainless tub is gorgeous!  I know, I know, it's just a washer, but I am so proud of this washer!"
B00UZRV9MG,Portable Compact Washer and Spin Dry Cycle with Built in Pump (33L Washer & 16L Spin Dryer),Major Appliances,5,"I just got this little washer yesterday. Well not little, it was actually quite big, which was great because I thought it would hold a lot less clothing. Very light and easy to operate. I washed 4 loads right out the box and the spinner was amazing. It pretty much dried out my clothes. DO NOT expect this to heat dry your clothes. Its a spin dryer like the spin cycle on a regular washer. Noise is not bad, It does make some so don't expect it to be silent. Make sure the hose is up and on normal when you are filling it or it would spill out (Learned that the hard way.) Also the hose does not fit my sink. I did not have a problem with that because I just filled it with a bucket as in my opinion, it would take forever with the hose. I also wash in my bathtub because when draining, the hose needs to be leveled and is on the bottom. If anything, that would be the only issue I have with this washer. The hose should've been on top for easy draining. Little bit of soap goes a long way. I washed shirts, socks, undies, hand towels and wash cloths. Tonight I will try jeans and towels and see how that works. Clothes do get tangled so get a mesh bag to prevent it. Overall, This machine gets 5 stars. I wanted to get a Panda, since it seems to be the top of the line twin tub washer but I couldn't afford 200+shipping. I'm hoping this lasts a while. I will check in with another update soon via video so people can see how this beauty works! If you know what to expect using these, I suggest this. If you don't know much about these machines, please YouTube it before buying. Some people expect too much but this is EXACTLY what I expected and I'm satisfied."

They also fit my paper thin stove gaps, which is one of the reasons I just bought another set.  However,  the other reason I bought another set is because the white stove gap covers are flimsy and damage very easily, so while I was cutting chicken on my counter with kitchen scissors, the stove gap flipped up and was slashed when I snipped skin off the chicken.<br /><br /> Although there are heavier-duty stove gap covers out there,  these work better for me because they can be maneuvered into extra thin stove gaps.

Amazon was quick to provide me with another unit as I was not satisfied with this difference, however, the new unit still shows a difference of 5 degrees.  The internal temperature stayed consistent, but for those who don't confirm the actual temperature can be storing their wine at a total different temperature than desired."

B00FYOLSNA,Amana ABB1924BRM 18.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Bottom Freezer Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,5,"This refrigerator does not have a water dispenser in the door, or an icemaker in the freezer, or multiple doors to access your food. It's a solid, basic, ergonomically-correct refrigerator that's quiet, keeps our food cold, and looks great in stainless steel. Plus I love the 18 cu ft size because it's roomy inside but does not overpower the kitchen. A simple digital display inside the fridge shows the temp setting for both the fridge and the freezer, with easy up-down arrows to change (4 is recommended). The fridge itself has everything at eye level for easy finding and reach. The bottom freezer pulls straight out like a big smooth drawer for easy access to a top and bottom wire rack. Personally I removed the plastic dividers inside the freezer racks to accommodate/make more room for odd-shaped stuff. Just a great fridge.  Remember when kitchen appliances were quality-made and lasted for years? Ah the last of a dying breed, get it while you can. By the way Amana is owned by Whirlpool."

B00PVX0Z0Q,"Maytag Neptune Washer Front Loader (2) Bearings, 2 Oil Seals, O-Ring kit 12002022",Major Appliances,5,"The parts arrived quickly but the seals were missing (only 3 parts in the box).  I contacted Customer Service, and they shipped out a whole new kit right away without question.  The parts were an exact fit for my Amana front loader.  I bought the machine for $750.  They wanted $775 to repair the bearings (the Maytag method requires them to replace the entire outer drum).  This repair can only be done if you have the special tools to pull the old bearings and press the new ones.  I used a 1/2&#34; threaded rod (3/4&#34; rod would be better), a 2&#34; length of 3&#34; conduit, and various nuts and washers that I had to machine to the necessary diameters,  Remove the drive end bearing first.  It will help to freeze the bearings and coat the drum and outer bearing surfaces with grease immediately prior to installation.  They must be perfectly square to go in smoothly."

After a few months I noticed water pooling in the refrigerator. After three trips from service it was determined it was a design flaw on a small sheet metal guide that was supposed to help funnel water into the evaporation pan. It was replaced and all was fine for a time. Now the refrigerator is freezing up and consequently can not cool. 50 degrees is not a safe operating temperature for a refrigerator. I called the same repair place but they are so busy repairing new Samsung appliances that are still under warranty they will not even take work that is not under warrantee. Samsung customer service, after keeping me on line for 25 minutes, suggested I call someone to come fix what ever was wrong with it. I never got the list of approved vendors. Poorly designed and engineered.   All shelving is fairly flimsy plastic. After just two years I am faced with buying another new refrigerator. It won't be a Samsung."

We unpacked them--they were in perfect condition! They were fairly easy to install, but be sure to check out some of the other reviews--you do need an extra hose or two for the steamers.

B00CY31848,"Bosch SHP65TL5UC 500 Series 24"" Dishwasher with Flush Handle 16 Place Settings 44 dBA Sound RackMatic Delay Start Express Cycle Leak Protection InfoLight and Energy Star Rating in Stainless",Major Appliances,2,"Yes, it's quiet, but this dishwasher completely falls down on ease of use.<br /><br />Once a program is selected and it's been started, you can't stop it. This problem is made much more annoying by the fact that it's constantly getting itself turned on when you brush against it and then when you accidentally activate the start button (also easy to do by brushing against it) it stubbornly refuses to let you cancel whatever random settings (also easy to set by brushing against it) it had at the moment you accidentally started it. I've tried turning it off, pulling the plug out, but nothing works. Didn't they test this design in actual day-to-day use and notice this design problem??? All these settings and on/off buttons are right on the top where you would expect to brush against them all the time. And this problem happens all the time. Right now I have a load accidentally running on delicate setting. I'm just hoping I don't have to run it all through again as, even on auto setting it's been known not to clean thoroughly. Often I have a mostly empty dishwasher that I'm not ready to start but is determined to go on.<br /><br />Design suggestion for Bosch, make it so the touch sensitive buttons are recessed. Or at least make the start button impossible to activate accidentally.<br /><br />If there is some secret button press combination that lets you undo settings once it's started, I'd love to know what it is. I wasn't able to spot it in the manual.<br /><br />Also, the crazily complex instructions for what specific cutlery type is supposed to go where in the upright cutlery rack are a joke (there are about 80 slots all labeled; are you supposed to keep the guide handy at all times or learn them by heart?). We just ignore them."

B00FGWUF0C,Bosch WTB86200UC 300 4.0 Cu. Ft. White Stackable Electric Dryer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"I don't have this particular dryer, but I do have a Bosch Axxis dryer that's less than 10 years old, and I will say that based on that experience, I will never ever get a Bosch dryer ever again. Way overly complicated controls that don't really work. Dryer turns on and off constantly, like every 30 seconds -- talk about maddening. And it takes way too long to dry clothes. I am very surprised Bosch put such a high priced piece of junk out there."
B0051OKX2U,The pureWash Professional-Grade Ionic Laundry Purifier (High-Efficiency Washers),Major Appliances,5,"This was a replacement for a unit I purchased with my washer/dryer 4 years ago. Results to me are stunning. I expect to get 3+ years of service from this unit. Zero cost for soap, softeners etc. I live in SD (NOT the softest water?)<br /> The person I bought it from lives in Ohio and claims 5+ years of service. My wife and houseguest love it. What else can I say? This unit ROCKS!"

B00J5CA1T4,(4-Pack) - GE RPWF Compatible Refrigerator Water and Ice Filter by Zuma Filters,Major Appliances,2,"I thought I'd give these a try since they are so much cheaper than the GE brand.  After two months, I've gone back to the GE brand, despite the cost.  I noticed that the water flow was reduced with the Zuma filters, but that wasn't such a big deal.  What I could no longer take was the noise the refrigerator (GE Cafe) made when the Zuma was installed.  It made a high-pitched whine that was pretty loud. In my open-concept main floor, it was more than I could take.  Today I bought and installed the GE brand filter and the fridge is back to its quiet self."
B00O06XCIM,Frigidaire 242294502 Refrigerator Water Filter Bypass,Major Appliances,4,Fixed my problem. Ice maker is rocking again. There was an extra fin on the filter.

It arrived without any Freon (or whatever it is now called)!  The dealer fixed that but now 20 months later, the compressor is failing. Repairman said it would be $600-800 to fix! That is 1/3 the cost of a new one! Warranty is just 12 months. I tried to call the 1-800-GEcares line which is a joke. There is no way to get a human to answer that line.<br /><br />I'd be cautious with GE dual cooling units."

B00A0P278S,"Electrolux EIFLS60JI 4.3 Cubic Foot Capacity Front Load Washer with Perfect Steam and IQ Touch Contro,",Major Appliances,4,"One of the reasons is that many front load washer dryer sets when stacked push the washer out a few inches because the washer slopes back at the top. Also the dryer exhaust hookup is flush with the back of the dryer on every other brand we looked at so that it must be out from the wall the width of the dryer vent, but Electrolux's has a recess to except the dryer vent hookup so that it can be closer to the wall. All this means that instead of the stacked set being 10&#34; deeper then the measurements when installed they are only 1&#34; more than the actual machine measurements. Because of where our set is installed this was paramount to our decision on what brand to buy. Other things we like are the push to open doors; very helpful if you have your hands full of laundry and for keeping the smaller kids from opening the washer. The door opening is also at least 2&#34; larger than most other brands."

B004MX8XO6,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"I do alot of buying on Amazon but almost never give anything 5 stars--or even bother to rate things, just because others seem to be doing a good job of it already. But this little dishwasher deserves special merit.  By sheer chance this dishwasher is just barely under the allowed dimensions for check in luggage. I fashioned a skin of cardboard around it and checked this all the way to Bangkok, where I've been using it for the past 10 months.  Yes, I had to use a stepdown transformer because it's 110v, but even so, the hoses fit perfectly even to our Bangkok sink, and the machine works beautifully every time--a real workhorse.  I wish the space were a tad larger as our standard plates don't exactly fit well--but then if it was larger, I probably wouldn't have gotten it into my checked luggage.  If I had an extra hand I'd give it three thumbs up."

More info here:<br /><br />http://spitnvinegar.blogspot.com/2014/11/oven-karma.html<br /><br />Original review after the oven was fixed the first time (it was dead on arrival):<br /><br />Okay, it's working now. And it is a great oven. Really it is. I hope I never have to deal with Fisher Paykel customer service again though. Read more to see why I feel that way....<br /><br />My oven doesn't work properly. They don't know why. They want to just swap parts again and again. They won't tell me their plan of action. What I thought would be a great oven is the worst oven of my life.<br /><br />I believe my oven is fixed. Turned out it was wired incorrectly when it was manufactured. It took a lot of effort on our part but we finally got a knowledgeable repair person who figured it out. Bless his heart, I am making him cookies. I give Fisher Paykel very low marks on customer<br />service. They have been impossible to communicate with and not very cooperative. It is annoying to spend lots of time on hold hearing about their great customer service and then not get any of that supposed customer service.<br /><br />I have hopes that it will be a good oven now. I pray I will never have to deal with Fisher Paykel &#34;customer service&#34; again.<br /><br />I credit the actual repair to the local company service manager. He was great."

Only issue was a missing leg when delivered but I contacted the seller and they sent one immediately and included a new wine opener with the part (small but nice gesture!).  Shelves look nice but have to be lifted and pulled out when loaded with bottles. A minor inconvenience but one I can live with.  The only thing I would like to see is a longer warranty by the seller (3 months,really?) and maybe an additional warranty that can be purchased through Amazon somehow.  Overall, a good wine fridge for beginners and just what I was looking for."

B00U7X6TRI,"LG LTCS20220S 20 cu.ft. 30"" Wide Top Mount Refrigerator with Factory Installed Ice System",Major Appliances,5,"I have this fridge in black. On the black model, the sides and top are textured, and the front is smooth metal. The smooth metal will show every finger print.<br /><br />The reason I chose this model (besides being an LG) was that it has no handles that stick out, they are recessed. And the way the door is made, you can make this a right hinge model or a left hinge model to suit your kitchen. It's a good thing this doesn't have handles because the fridge is THICK. It sticks out a good 8&#34; past my kitchen cabinets. My old fridge was wider and more flush with the cabinets.<br /><br />I love the interior. The LED lights (both compartments) are bright. The pantry drawer holds all my cheese, lunch meats, butter, etc.,and you can see it from above through the shelf above it. The bottom shelf on the door is perfect for holding beer bottles or soft drink cans. My old fridge was about the same cubic footage but this is designed better (my old one was a side-by-side).<br /><br />This fridge is plenty cold. I leave the refrigerator section at &#34;medium&#34; and I had to turn the freezer compartment down to 2 because 3 (medium) was freezing the ice cream so hard it was bending my spoons when trying to get it out of the carton. The freezer has LED lighting too.<br /><br />It's quiet, you can hardly hear it running even if standing beside it.<br /><br />It comes with a factory installed ice-maker which has a switch to keep it &#34;off&#34; if you don't have it hooked up to a water supply.<br /><br />Tiny complaints:<br />1. Smooth black on front shows finger prints.<br />2. The bottom door is closer to the floor (no grill under in front), so you need to watch your bare feet when opening the door or you'll hit the top of your foot (ouch!)<br />3.  If you close the bottom door too hard, the freezer compartment door will come open an inch or so, but quickly closes on its own.  It's pressure equalization and not a big deal to me. But I saw several complaints when reading other reviews before purchasing.<br /><br />BTW, I got mine at Lowe's. It's special order and took over 2 months for delivery.<br /><br />Made in Mexico.d took over 2 months for delivery.  Made in Mexico."

The bad news was that after 10 months, the compressor stopped working.  I contacted New Air and they were very helpful.  They sent me a return label and after they received the faulty unit, they sent me a replacement.  Unfortunately, I had to package my faulty unit and after 10 months, I didn't have any of the packaging materials.  That cost me nearly $20 for packaging!  The new unit arrived yesterday with the new box labelled with the arrows saying &#34;This side up&#34;.  Fedex apparently can't read!  The box was left on the front porch on its side!!???"

B000UVR4GM,Bosch SHE45M06UC Dishwasher with 4 Wash Cycles (Black),Major Appliances,1,"I bought this dishwasher in 2009. It has been awful from the start.  The trays are poorly designed and don't fit most current bowls, glassware etc. Thus bowls chip constantly from movement.  It has an unusual metallic smell after cleaning. It cleans very unevenly. It leaves a film on glassware. It dries so poorly that I have to hand dry every item. Water puddles at the bottom. I have had it serviced twice, used the recommended detergents, cleaned it with vinegar etc. I paid about $900 for this (in 2009!). I am finally giving up and replacing it. I would NOT purchase this.  My prior Bosch was also poorly performing. In contrast, my inexpensive Kitchenaid at our Lake house works like a charm and it's 15 years old."

B007HDDMNK,Danby DDW1899WP 8 Place Setting Portable Dishwasher - White,Major Appliances,5,"Review for Danby dishwasher model # DDW7899WP. This review is not for a verified purchase because I received the dishwasher as a gift from my parents. The most thoughtful gift I think I have ever received! My house is nearly 100 years old and the kitchen is almost all original. I have all of three outlets in the kitchen and one doesn't work unless the hallway light is on. Ha.<br /><br />The nice 18&#34; width means I can roll it away between my stove and my fridge, and it's tall enough to be level with the stove so I can use the top of the washer as counter space.<br /><br />I've been using my Danby for more than three years now. It's been great! The lighter load settings work well for lightly soiled dishes, but if you let them sit for a little too long like I have a tendency to do, the heavy load almost always does the trick.<br /><br />Cons: sometimes if you load the bottom rack with heavy plates, it will come off the track. Just while you are pushing the rack in, not while washing.<br />  Some heavily soiled dishes don't come out clean but that's true of all washers.<br />  Dishwasher salt is expensive. Someone told me you can use plain (no iodine) salt, but that voids any warranty so use at your own risk.<br />  Took me a while to learn all the different symbols. I had to check the manual a lot.<br />  NOT for a large family unless you are in a pinch and desperate.<br /><br />Pros:  Easy to set up and use<br />  Easy to keep the filters and arms clean, everything easy to remove and replace.<br />  Cleans really well<br />  Perfect for small kitchens or rentals where you can't install an undercounter dishwasher.<br /><br />I have had zero problems with this unit until a few days ago a small piece in the handle broke, so I had to pry the door open with a hammer! Quick removal of the door panel revealed the problem and a short internet search and I had my $4.70 handle assembly ordered. So relatively inexpensive replacement parts and ease of replacing is another pro."

The unit itself has a very stylish look I like and not afraid to showcase. As far as noise, it's as noisy as any other fridge, which is basically none at all. The downside is like what everyone else has mentioned; the pour speed. So, so, so slow. When I'm having a beer or 2 at home it's not bad, but when guests are over and it takes 90 secs to pour 1 beer, it gets annoying. I still recommend this product."

B001QGGGXC,Samsung : RS277ACRS 27 cu. ft. Side by Side Refrigerator - Real Stainless,Major Appliances,1,"Lasted only 6 years before compressor died.  Technician said Samsung refrigerators are junk and to stick with Whirlpool, Kenmore, etc."
B008VX01P2,"Whynter FM-62DZ Dual Zone Portable Refrigerator/Freezer, 62-Quart",Major Appliances,3,"As much as I wanted to like this machine, I just can't get there. Yes, it gets cold and keeps cold, but there are just too many ways in which this should have been better.<br /><br />Let's start off with its capacity. 62 quarts sounds like a lot, but you very soon realize it's not distributed properly. Neither the small nor the large compartments will take a standard grocery bag, and both compartments accommodate only tall and narrow items. That means when you drag your groceries out to the car, you have to unpack them to get them into these compartments! Then when you get home, you have 2 choices:<br />1. Lift out the internal baskets and take them inside, unpack the baskets into your refrigerator and freezer, and then return the baskets to this machine in your car, or<br />2. Unpack the baskets into the grocery bags you first unpacked at the store, and then bring the grocery bags inside for redistribution of their contents once again.<br /><br />Another problem this machine has is the time it takes to get cold. I leave mine in the back of my Suburban, but when I want to run to the store, I can't just plug it into the power port because it takes 2 hours for it to get cold enough to use! So now what I do is to leave both the included AC cord and the DC power port cord plugged into the machine. When I am planning to go to the store, I run an extension cord out to the Sub and plug in the AC cord. Letting it run for 2 hours, I can then start the car, plug in the DC power port cord, unplug and put away the AC power cord, and head for the store. Sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it? It's certainly more work than it should be!<br /><br />There's a minor quibble I have with the way Amazon ships these machines. They weigh in at 66 pounds, empty, and Amazon ships them as though they're 82 pounds. If you get this box and you don't like it, don't ask Amazon to charge you for shipping it back, because the difference between actual and listed weights will cost you a pretty penny!<br /><br />Another shortcoming is the plastic handles. Much has been made by other reviewers about the lack of durability with these handles, and they really do feel flimsy. I've been careful with mine, and so far there's been no trouble with them. But by no means do I trust them to be strong!<br /><br />This machine could have been so much better with 2 adjustments. First, it should be able to fit a standard grocery bag in each compartment without unpacking them. I certainly understand the aim of having so much insulation around each compartment, but I would have been more than happy to sacrifice a bit of efficiency for better packability. Second, this machine should have a turbo mode when on AC power. That would allow the unit to come down in temperature much more quickly before being asked to maintain those temperatures on DC power. If those 2 changes had been made before making this machine available to the market, I could easily have forgiven the problem with the handles.<br /><br />At more than $600, the value is not quite there for this machine, unless perhaps you have specific uses for it that do not match mine. My advice is to be extremely sure this machine will fit your needs before you try it out.y!<br /><br />Another shortcoming is the plastic handles.

B00E4O0J86,Z Line 455-30 Z Line 900 CFM Wall Mount Range Hood,Major Appliances,1,"While this range hood is priced fairly low, it is not even worth what they are charging. The metal is so thin that it was completely dented up when it arrived and had to be returned. Looking closer at the actual unit, the welds are very poorly done. The corner welds were already cracking and were very visible. Most units at this price are seamless, not this unit. Due to the damage, I never actually turned on the hood, so I cannot comment on any other functionality. Overall, it is a cheaply built hood that I would never want over my expensive 48&#34; pro range."

B001QFYDSI,Sharp Microwave Drawer Oven,Major Appliances,1,We installed this microwave in our new house in May of 2013. In July of 2015 it quit working. Just died. No power. No one in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area works on the microwaves - includes Texas Appliance -- which is where I bought it. Sharp customer service stinks. They can't provide the name of someone to come service the microwave and don't seem to care. You'd think a microwave that cost almost $900 would last longer than a $150 microwave. I'll never buy a Sharp product of ANY type ever again.

The controls are a little quirky, you have to put a &#34;0&#34; in front of the timer to set minutes but not all the time took some getting used to. The only real design flaw is that, unlike most microwaves where you push a button and the door pops open, you have to pull the handle on this one. And the machine is so small and light that you need two hand to open the door or the whole thing moves around and doesn't open. This can be a pain. But if you need this size, the cooking is fine."

B0055UBB4O,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,4,"After having read reviews for more expensive upmarket brand microwaves like LG and Panasonic, we went to our local (Canadian) Wal Mart to see what they had.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this one is that it is completely stainless steel: front AND back; outside and inside; all around. It looks like a professional food service microwave. To me, the stainless steel interior is easier to clean than a white painted one.<br /><br />We have heard that microwave ovens don't last like they used to (we have one low quality unbranded OTR one in a mobile home at the moment which was new in 1995 & still working as well as it ever did, and another LG 900 watt in an RV from 2004, also a good runner at this writing, July 2013).<br /><br />We didn't want to spend a lot of money if the microwave was only going to last a couple of years. Well, with this Danby, we have a two year replacement warranty. If it dies before its time, we either get a new one or a refund of the money we spent on this one. Fair enough, I thou... Read more"

It keeps things cool - like hard-to-come-by real eggs, chocolates, protein bars, that sit on the removable tray. The main area keeps soda cans cool, or remove the tray and place 4 regular water bottles.<br />It came with a car adapter so in the US it'd be a good traveler. Some reviews complain it's not COLD. That's cuz its a 'COOLER'..it's NOT a fridge that meets higher standards. It converts to 'Warming' too..so I can keep my soup warm if I need to leave suddenly.<br />All around - extremely practical, versatile, very portable, simple, affordable, and a mood lifter to boot.<br />I'm...

B001F86EW4,Thermador Masterpiece Deluxe Series SGSX365FS 36 Gas Cooktop 5 Star Burners,Major Appliances,1,"There was an old Thermador gas cook top in our house when we bought it in 1990.  It worked flawlessly for 21 years so when we renovated the kitchen in 2012, naturally we replaced the (still working) cooktop with the top-of-the-line Thermador SGSX36FS.  The new cooktop performed great when it was working but the electronic sparkers failed (constantly sparking w. gas on or off) in June of 2015, just 3 years after installation.<br />I took the Thermador cooktop into an authorized Thermador repair center and as of today, it has been in for service for 42 days with no date-certain for completion.  The service manager claims that the electronic igniter module and all 5 controls require replacement.  To do this replacement, the tech must remove the burners and one of them had to be drilled out because the manufacturer did not apply anti-seize compound to the brass orifice nut which ultimately bonded to the aluminum burner.  Essentially, the service tech is rebuilding the entire inside assembly as there aren’t many more parts in a 5 burner cook top than the igniter, 5 controls and a burner.  (4 burners and some tubing to be exact)<br />The service manager says that they are still waiting for parts from Thermador.  The service bill has risen to more than $550 and they are not yet done.  I have contacted Thermador customer service requesting to expedite the parts and perhaps provide some good-will reimbursement for the catastrophic failure of most of the internal parts in just 3 years.<br />Do some investigation on Thermador customer service and you will find this blog quote  “since my departure as a Regional Service Manager for Thermador, many of the policies and procedures have changed for the worse, probably due to the many cost cutting measures being taken by Thermador’s parent company, German based, B/S/H/ (Bosch-Siemens) Home Appliances Corporation.”"

After purchasing the product my husband's friend who repairs refrigerators told us it was a mistake because Samsung makes terrible products. A year and a half later the fridge broke . We lost $1200 dollars. Moreover the only company that does repairs on samsungs in our area also had terrible reviews and charges $200 to show up (not even fix anything). I called the Samsung customer service department which I recommend you call before purchasing. It was terrible customer service. You cannot press zero or say &#34;agent&#34; to get through to a customer service person. You have to wait on hold. I literally spent an entire hour on the phone not to mention all the calls to Lowes and my bank to track down the receipt for the product. Lowes only keeps receipts for 30 days and I had to get months of bank statements to even get Samsung to have a conversation with me about a refund. I had to throw a fit to get Samsung to agree to repair the fridge for free. Still waiting to see how it works out, but I would never buy a samsung again. Our old ugly fridge that was 10 years old never had a problem and this one couldn't last 1.5 years without breaking down."

The bottom is held down with cement bricks that come with it. (must say it looks strange, sort of like an afterthought) The lower compartment below the over feel unfinished. The range is very hard to level. Came very poorly packed (far worse that you can imagine) , with scratches on the body. I did not return it as I needed one desperately. There are very few ranges that fit in 24&#34;. The range is installed not and works fine so far but am disappointed with the quality. Oh, also despite high high price of  $999, it did not come with a broiler pan.  The counter is 24&#34; deep and the oven is only 21&#34; deep, so we had a gap left on both sides and back and no way to fill it. There is an aluminium strip set that you can buy on Amazon but they are only 18&#34; long. They wont work for the sides. So you will have a very hard time finding something to cover the sides as well as the back. I am still scratching my head as to what to do."

B004MX8XO6,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,1,Don't Bother !! Your dishes pretty much need to be completely clean BEFORE you put them in the dishwasher which means you don't need a dishwasher! This apparatus doesn't clean even silverware. The handle to open the door is in an odd spot (front) and very hard to open. Water pressure is poor. Layout of where you can put your dishes and glasses in rack is poor. There is no place to hang the hoses or electrical cord when not in use so they just hang there in the back dripping all over the floor or you can drape them over the top which is an eye sore. Ugly and an eye sore.

You cannot select hot or warm wash and cold rinse so you waste a lot of warm or hot water. You can't set it back to the beginning of the cycle if you want to add a few more items you found. It does not spin well and the drain and spin cycle adds water.  You can't tell where in the cycle it is.  I am so frustrated I am thinking of getting rid of it and buying another product. It is only 7 months old and has me mad every time I use it. And finally you have to push the button, and then wait to open the lid."

B004N4MSPO,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"I did not purchase this on Amazon but think it's amazing!<br /><br />I've lived in my house almost 10 years and haven't had a dishwasher, I bought this a few months ago and loved it from the very beginning.<br /><br />Be careful when you are connecting the hoses to the back of the dishwasher, the nuts are plastic, I accidentally over tightened the nut on the outlet hose and ended up cracking it.  After a quick trip to the hardware store to buy a replacement hose I was mostly back in business (the replacement hose does not fit on the quick connect but I just lay the hose in the sink drain).  SPT does sell replacement hoses but I had waited so long to have a dishwasher at my house I couldn't wait even a day for a replacement hose LOL.<br /><br />The dishwasher ran great for a couple weeks then I ran it one night and it quit draining, I could hear the pump running but no water was coming out.  It finally quit and started beeping and wouldn't quit.  I talked to my uncle that can fix anything and he told me to hook a water line up to the outlet hose and run water backup through it.  One of the pieces in my replacement hose kit allowed me to hook the outlet hose up to my garden hose.  I turned the hose on just a little bit and it made a weird gurgly noise and then a big squirt, as it turns out somehow a sneaky avocado stem had gotten past the filter (I don't think I had it installed right at one point) and had lodged itself in the pump.  Ever since I ran water back up through the dishwasher it has worked perfectly and I plan on doing this as a preventative step every month or so.<br /><br />I live alone and run this every 2-3 days.  It definitely saves me water.  I was curious exactly how much water it used so I plugged the sink one time and it filled the sink but it still had a little ways before the sink was going to be overflowing.  I can use 3 times that much water doing the amount of dishes this dishwasher can hold so that made me even more happy with my dishwasher.<br /><br />I purchased a rolling cart to keep this dishwasher on so it did not take up my limited counter space and added a large hook to the side to hold the hoses up to keep them from leaking on my floor when I'm not using it."

Called the store, who referred me to a local repair place, they don't service anymore, called back, second doesn't help, gave up called Frigidaire and asked if any ideas, they had none other than ... &#34;did you read the manual, what does it say if this happens&#34; I am paraphrasing, asked for a service guy, it is going to take 3 weeks. Going to call and see if I can return and get a different unit. Unit might be ok, who knows, but some of the worst customer service I have encountered, you could tell by her attitude she just flat didn't care."

B006BYHPKW,The Laundry Alternative Eco-egg Automatic Mini Washing Machine,Major Appliances,5,"1.  Reason I bought the Eco-Egg:  May the old washer rest in peace as I await about 6 weeks for the arrival of a new front load washer.  In the  meanwhile, I bought the Eco-Egg Washer, which arrived in a few days. Some of you who are still reading this lengthy review may wonder, why someone would spend money on a small washing machine, while waiting for delivery of a large washer.  I am sure all regions are different, but I recently went to a laundry mat and spent $85 to wash and dry 14 loads of laundry.  The Eco-Egg can handle most of our typical summer loads with the exception of bed linens, sheets and bath towels.  Since I wash and dry about 7 loads per week, the Eco-Egg Washer should save me about $30 per week in laundry mat expenses.  2.  Cord Length:  First of all, the cord is heavy duty and approximately a good 93 inches long, depending on how one measures it.  3.  Washing:  It seems to wash like a high efficiency washing machine.  I use a  quality brand name HE detergent and get excellent cleaning results.  4.  Washing Example:  I used a couple of white rags to clean the floor, where an old washer, which had been in the same spot for 16 years resided.  Anyway, one can only imagine the amount of accumulated dust and dirt which accumulated underneath that old washer.  Due to the extreme dirt, I did two &#34;wash only&#34; cycles in hot water using the Laundry Alternative Eco-egg Automatic Mini Washing Machine.  Then I did a quick rinse.  Then I ran the Eco-Egg on the full automatic cycle with HE detergent and some bleach.  The filthy rags are white again.  Now that is amazing for a small washer that cost about $121, including tax.  5.  Load Size:  Here are several examples of the size of loads it has done.   Load 1:  Five pairs of white crew socks   Load 2:  4 wash clothes and one hand towel   Load 3:  One pair of Large cotton stretch shorts and one L cotton t-shirt   Load 4:  One pair of Large heavy duty cotton men's walking shorts   Load 5:  One XL rayon top(NOTE:  The rayon is a thin fabric.) and one XL stretch cotton capris.   Load 6:  Four white 15 inch X 10 inch thin cotton cleaning rags   Load 7:  2 Men's Large cotton t-shirts and 2 sweatbands   Load 8:  4 pairs of Men's cotton brief underwear  Timing for the above 8 loads:  If you only use the wash cycle, hand wring them out and hand rinse them in a sink bowl of water.  The above eight loads can be washed, hand rung and rinsed in about 80 minutes to 120 minutes, depending on how you use the machine.  Timing for one load:  If you use the automatic cycle, one load takes about 35 minutes to automatically wash and automatically rinse each load.  Then, you will need about two minutes in-between loads to wring out the loads before you dry them on a line or dry them in a dryer.  So, for 8 small loads the rinsing, washing and wringing will take about 5 hours.  On the bright side, one can do other things while the washer automatically washes the small loads.  6.  Conclusion:  The wringing takes a little more work than with a $600 Washing machine which spins out the water, but this washer does not cost that much.  I did not mind wringing out the clothes.   I liked this small washer so much, that I bought a small oak stand for which it to sit in the bathroom next to the sink. I hope to use it for certain small loads for the rest of my laundry  life.    To the Engineer of this small washer:  Thank you for the design.  It is perfect.  I hope you consider making these Eco-Egg Washers in 2 sizes. The first size exactly the same size, exact light weight size and look as the one which I purchased.  I hope to see a second Eco-Egg Washer slightly larger, which can hold at least one pair of blue jeans, large bath towel or one king size sheet with a spin cycle at a reasonable price, but hopefully weighs under 30 pounds. Since, I am not an engineer, I do not know, if this is possible.  7.  Hint:  If you have a dryer,  Wash and wring out several small similar-fabric/similar colors loads before placing them in a dryer.  This will help reduce wrinkles.  Put them in a bucket to carry them to the dryer."

B0057WCGJ4,"Bosch 800 Series SHX68T55UC Fully Integrated Built-in Dishwasher 24"" in Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,4,"I’ve been using this dishwasher for 3 months now and, in general, am happy with it. My favorite feature is how quiet it is. My least favorite feature is that it doesn’t dry the dishes.  The sanitize feature helps with this somewhat, but it increases the cycle time. I also wish I bought a different outside front.  The stainless steel is the worst with fingerprints. I have to clean it two-three times before they all come off and no streaks are left.<br /><br />I agree with others that plates work well in this dishwasher, but my bowls don’t fit well at all. If the tines were not slanted my bowls would fit.<br /><br />The little 3rd rack works somewhat.  There is no direct water source to the rack so if the rack directly underneath is very full the 3rd rack items do not get very clean.<br /><br />I was used to having a heating element for drying, so it has been an adjustment for me to open the dishwasher and the dishes are still somewhat wet.  The racks themselves are very wet.  I now open the dishwasher and let them air dry.  It’s rather inconvenient as we have to walk around the lowered door while the dishes dry.  I’m now trying to wash just after dinner so I can pull the door open before bed and in the morning the dishes are dry and we don’t have to walk around the lowered door."

B003GFAY52,Broan 30W in. QP2 Under Cabinet Range Hood,Major Appliances,3,"This is a beautiful range hood and the LED lighting is excellent and has 3 settings from low to high, just as the fan does.

The right side does not pull up any air/steam/smoke.  I thought we had made an error during installation, so I called the Broan tech support people.  They told me the fan is offset (to the left) and that indeed, there is virtually no vacuum on the right side, although the air/smoke/steam will &#34;eventually&#34; get to the left and be filtered. I'm not totally convinced about that, so if I have a big pot of water to boil, I'll use the burner on the left.<br />The lights are great, though."

I usually wash my things, then turn off machine, re-start, and re-do the whole cycle again without detergent to get two rinses. Without the second rinse my laundry was too hard. I hang my stuff out or put it on a dryer rack so I can't &#34;soften&#34; in a dryer. I am surprised at how much you can put in a load. I washed 2 towels, a face cloth, 4 XXL shirts, 4 underwear, 4 pairs of socks, and a long night gown. I usually do 4 pairs of XXL jeans in a load also. I had a little bit of trouble screwing the adapter unto my faucet (thought I was over tightening it), but once one of my &#34;guy friends&#34; got it tight, it worked perfectly. I leave the adapter on my bathroom sink and just remove the hose coupler. I had NO leaks, no problems, works great, and saves me time and money. It is also very quiet."

The cubes stick together if you leave them in the tray, but they are easy to break up with the scoop. It is loud, but we are used to it. My biggest complaint is cleaning it. From what I am reading, I shouldn't use tap water because it will start forming mold. It would be nice if you could open the entire top to really clean it because it is almost impossible to clean the inside well. I would give it 5 stars otherwise. Love the ice it makes and how convenient it is. Run vinegar and water solution through it at least once a month. Also, I find q-tips and a clean soft bristled toothbrush are the best way to reach inside to clean it. Be careful though...plastic is very cheap and thin inside. Totally worth the money though."

B00EQ7MKHO,Samsung DW80F800 Top Control Dishwasher with Stainless Steel Tub,Major Appliances,1,"We've had three repairs in two years. The first one (1E High Temp heating error) was fixed under warranty.  This was documented with SAMSUNG and they had record of it. The second repair a few months later when it was out of warrant we did ourselves (5E Drain Error).  The hose needed to be replaced $35 cost online for an OEM hose.  The one we removed stunk like garbage and there was disgusting gook all through it.  This was in June of 2015.  It's now August 11th and it's having the same 5E drain error.  I can continue to fix this myself but this is obviously a poorly manufactured product, and an expensive one too.  SAMSUNG did agree to pick up the cost of a tech coming out this time but I still have to pay a &#34;diagnostic&#34; fee which is still TBD by the service provider. Probably $100 at least.  In other words, SAMSUNG only partially back their junk dishwasher if they do at all.  Stick to phones and electronics guys.  Appliances suck it.  We have a fridge too.  ice maker bites!"

B00570QTQC,NEW Replacement Part - Kenmore Washer Clutch Kit Part# 285785,Major Appliances,5,"Exact Replacement Parts sent me a new clutch kit made by Jason Industries LTD. which matched the picture shown exactly. The quality was as good as the original parts. They fit just right, not too tight and not loose either. I have installed the clutch and it is working flawlessly. It was shipped and arrived on time. There is a video from Repair Clinic on you tube that walks you through the replacement step by step, very helpful. I will update this if any changes occur."
B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,1,much louder than our old new air 100 series.  makes significantly less ice as well.  very loud motor sound. the overall size is substantially smaller even though its not described to be so slow.  good for 1-2 people but not a family of 5.  it does not make enough ice in a day to satisfy the family. very disappointed..
B00KVMEFMQ,"SPT SD-2202S Countertop Dishwasher with Delay Start, Silver",Major Appliances,5,I didn't have room to install a full size dishwasher so I decided to try this one.  It works great easy hook up and the dishes are clean. It just 2 of us and this is perfect.
B002ZV0OJO,NewAir AW-121E 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,4,"I purchased two of these.  Spent the extra money for next day delivery, and yes it did show up on time with my only complaint it was left outside my door delivered upside down even though there was &#34;This Side Up&#34; arrows.  Amazon should use LARGER arrows and message. Packaged really well.  Had both set up and inserted into a built in area for wine within minutes (lots of air flow) and filled them with my wines from another larger failing unit.  My intentions were to use one for red and one for white, but they can only be set to 54 degrees, so really no point...I missed that fact in the purchase.  Still using one for reds and one for whites and champagne, but they are both set at 54 which is good.  They reached temp very quick....absolutely silent, almost no noise at all.  They are very attractive looking which was one of the main reasons I purchased it.  I plan on building a wine room down the road so at this price they are nearly disposable when the time comes.  Only regret is that the  hinges are not reversible, so I could not have one on the right an done on the left so they both opened from the middle.  Holds temperature well.  I have them both full.  A little tight for larger champagne bottles, but you just remove a shelf to fit them. Still I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone."

It is very quite. Looks nice.<br />It takes 2 1/2 hrs for normal cycle to wash dishes - seriously? We've had GE and Kitchenaid in the past - the cycle time was half - they lasted 8 - 10 yes.<br />The racks are the worst in my opinion. All tines are at an angle. If you are washing plates, it works well. The tines on the bottom rack do not fold. The moment you load wine glasses, tupperware, pots/pans - you can barely fit anything. If you wash only plates, consider it. Anything else, look at other brands.<br />I've reached out to the manager at the store to see if we can return the unit - bad decision to buy."
B000UVWGGK,Broan 403004 30 In. Stainless Steel Ducted Range Hood,Major Appliances,1,"This item is exactly as described--so thats not my reason for the 1 star rating. We received this and my husband spent EIGHT hours installing! 8 hours. Only to get to the end of the install and realize the light cover that is supposed to cover the bulb had a broken prong. Without that prong the entire cover will not work. I contacted Amazon and they said my only option was to return the ENTIRE Hood. ( the one thats now a part of my house--screwed, glued, fastened to my HOUSE!!) I am so disappointed that we worked so hard to replace this thing and now becasue one piece was sent to us broken, its still not complete. I just need a light cover and of course only THIS one made by this company for this specific hood will work. Great product if you dont receive any parts broken. :("
B0086I5YAE,"NewAir AI-215SS Portable Ice Maker,Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,2,I bought this ice maker with hopes it would perform and it does perform the ice cube making pretty well.. BUT it does have its problems.  The buttons on the LCD panel do not always work with me having to press a half inch to the side of buttons to make them register sometimes or just press random all over to try to get it to do what I want it to do.  I'm also not entirely sure the 3 ice cube sizes change the ice cubes that come out of the machine... they all appear to be the same to me.

Nine out of ten loads become unbalanced which prompts the washer to refill the tub and try it again which NEVER works.  Before you know it your 35 minute &#34;quick wash&#34; takes an hour and a half!  I have to &#34;check on&#34; my washer more than I do on my toddler.  I never write reviews but feel compelled to do so with this one so others don't have to go through the same thing.  Those writing 5 start reviews must not have had their's for very long because it started out fine but two years later it's the worst appliance in my house.  DO NOT PURCHASE!

It is definitely for the Panasonic larger microwave so make sure you have the exact model as this one. It is 16 1/2&#34; in diameter, so if you have a smaller microwave - this will not fit. Excellent turn around after ordering - It was packaged very well and arrived before expected."
B00DNGWOIY,Whirlpool Gas Range Oven Stove Ignitor Igniter 7432P143-60,Major Appliances,3,"The picture I saw showed the igniter with a connector attached. Be advised, there is no connector. There is a plus and a minus to that. The minus is, its not  &#34;plug and play&#34;. You have to cut the wires from the old igniter and use the supplied ceramic wire nuts to  reattach the original connector. The plus is, you can cut the wires off the old igniter from  inside the stove and use the supplied ceramic wire nuts to attach the new part. This means the stove can stay in place, no need to pull the stove out and remove the back of the stove. While not shown in the picture, the new part is NOT identical to the old one. There was an additional flange on the igniter heat shield opposite the flange used to screw the igniter in. This flange projected to low contacting the bottom of the oven making it fit improperly and the metal cover over the whole unit, the floor of the oven, could not be reinstalled. I could have swapped the old heat shield in place of the new one but the new part has the heat shield molded into the ceramic block making it impossible to remove. Once I ground the flange off the new part, it worked perfectly."

B009VU6WXY,Samsung RF263BEAESR 25.6 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"Between 2 and 3 years after purchase, my Samsung RF263BEA.. refrigerator started leaking water, inside.  It was past warranty, so I had to pay to have it fixed.  Refrigerators should be designed and built to last.  Every other one I have ever owned lasted more than 10 years or at least until I moved.  I am an engineer by education and most of my career has been in (manufacturing and engineering of) complex engineered equipment.  This problem was clearly due to either a design error or a quality failure.  This type of failure should result in a product recall, with the manufacturer fixing its error.  However, although the RF263BEA model line apparently has had quite a number of these failures, which seem to occur after 2 years of service, Samsung does not stand behind this product.  It is the last Samsung appliance I will ever buy."

OF COURSE, EXCELLENT CLEANING IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST!!!<br />1) Could not be more than 24&#34; in DEPTH! This eliminated MOST American designed DW! Bosch = 23-3/4&#34; in depth.<br />2) Price should not exceed $800 installed. Paid: $719 (+ TAX) + installation and haul away were on special...FREE! (saved $120)<br />3) MUST HAVE Stainless Steel Tub. YES<br />4) Must dry thoroughly. Even though the Bosch lacks a visable heating coil, Drying is excellent. Note: CYCLES ARE VERY SLOW.<br /> 4b) Considering item 4 above, item SHOULD have delayed start times(this one does)...YES. Note: unit also has programmable shut off times.<br />5) Energy efficient. YES.<br />6) Sanitize function. YES<br />7)Quick wash. Yes...60 Minute cycle available...actual times vary (usually LONGER)!<br />8) Unit must have front panel time remaining lit display (top controls  sometimes melt w/ hot water temps)<br />All in all, the Bosch 300 met all of my own criteria + BOSCH MAKES ABOUT THE QUIETEST DISHWASHER IN THE MARKET, THAT I AM AWARE OF. The model 300 is no exception...sound level is advertised at 46db, which is almost 10db lower that the 12 yr old Bosch that it replaced! (I do not work for them either)<br />Note: as with most, this DW is made in different configurations. Mine had stainless steel exterior as well =as ss tub. This model is also available with top controls. I need and prefer front controls/display.<br />I shopped for weeks trying to find the ideal DW in my price range. I hope my review helps anyone &#34;on the fence&#34;"
B00EQ7MKHO,Samsung DW80F800 Top Control Dishwasher with Stainless Steel Tub,Major Appliances,1,"We purchased this dishwasher new from Home Depot and from day one having issues. Soap residue stays on the dishes, dishes come out dirty. We talked to Samsung, they sent the tech who looked into it and blamed the water in the house been too hot and us not knowing how to use the unit and not pre-rinsing ALL the dishes. He put in the report that there are no issues with the dishwasher. Never buy Samsung unless you are looking for problems."

Hoping for better luck with another brand.<br /><br />I called Kitchen Aid Experience for Major Appliances and told them all about my experience with this dishwasher to give them a chance to make it right. In the end, they said, 'We're sorry you had a bad experience but there is nothing we can do.'"

The 2 heads were actually slightly farther apart than the original filter. I was able to get the new one in eventually by pushing with ridiculous force. After running 2 gallons through it the water still tastes like tap. The old filter never allowed the water to taste like this. Will not order from you again.

Dealing with the Bosch customer service group has been horrible...required like 8 phone calls to get a replacement part ordered under warranty, and then they wanted $99 for a tech to install it.  I finally convinced them to just send me the part for free so I could install it myself.  After removing the plastic trim from the inside, discovered that the screw holding the top part of the handle is behind a metal piece that seemed impossible to remove.  I just drilled through the metal and was able to get it done.  Whew!"

B00CKFI8HU,"SPT IM-600US Stainless Steel Under-Counter Ice Maker, 50-Pound",Major Appliances,4,"I bought this item &#34;refurbished&#34; for $585.  Excellent value, unit had a small cosmetic dent on top corner and a ding in the back bottom panel.  The unit was most likely rejected by someone, inspected but not fixed, and resold.  Unit has been making ice in my shop for two weeks straight, 70F inside temp with 50F degree water.  The unit is comparable to a pre 90's era refrigerator/freezer for noise, and may bother some, but not me.  In five hours, the unit will fill the internal &#34;20lb&#34; capacity bucket about 2/3 full.  The main design issue is the unit releases ice from the rear, not the top.  A sheet of ice will hang up on the release cam and unit stops making ice before the bin is full.  If you're actively watching it, the unit will make 75lbs of ice daily.  For cleaning, get a 5lb bag of food grade citric acid, $18 on amazon, and put a tablespoon in the water trough and let it run 30 minutes in wash mode.  At the scratch and dent price of $585, no shipping or sales tax, the unit is an excellent value.  The reason for four stars and not five is the ice bin only fills 2/3 full, without manual intervention.  The mode selection control is in the back, and that's fine.  I'd ignore the 1 star ratings b/c of this &#34;apparent flaw.&#34;  I intend to put an RO system before this unit, for another $150 also available on amazon.  Ignore the &#34;cloudy ice&#34; comments.  Without proper water treatment, even commercial ice makers would fail to deliver."

B00PYDN0NM,LG LFXS29626S French Door Refrigerator with 29 Cu. Ft. Capacity in Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,5,"Great fridge!  I've had this unit running for about a month now and so far so good.  We liked the fact is has two ice makers so we always have plenty of ice on hand.  This is my first fridge with the inverter linear compressor and I love it.  This Energy Star technology makes the fridge very efficient at cooling.  The circulation fans keeps the humidity low and there is plenty of LED lighting so you can find whatever you need.<br /><br />**Update 3-7-16<br /><br />The linear compressors in this fridge are amazing.  When they first start up, it has a slight high pitch whine but after about 10 seconds, it goes away and isn't noticeable.  Another unique feature is the fact it has an ultrasonic vibrator on the enclosed cooling coils which goes off on timed intervals to literally shake the dust off the coils.  If the coils are kept clear of dust and debris, the fridge can remain as efficient and cool as possible.  Yet another unique and useful feature of this LG model.  (As an aside, my LG front load washer also has the linear compressor and is working like  champ)<br /><br />If you found my review helpful please hit the yes button below.  Thanks!"

If you have a warranty they do not honor it for what happens to this stove and believe me a lot if wrong with it.<br />First of all I had the stove less than one year, last Thanksgiving was the first time I used the stove, - the whole room heats up with the stove it feels like the heat comes out from the door, also the steam that is generated from cooking or food drips down in between the glass of the oven door and is impossible to removed. So ther eare three streaks that cannot be removed and looks bad. The company sent someone out because it was within the warranty time and they said, &#34;oh that is cosmetic&#34; it is not covered&#34;.

The tech said it was in tolerance because it was less than 3/16&#34; off.  I said how would you know as you never measured it.  He said he can tell.  I told him I measured it and it is off between 1/4&#34; and 5/16&#34;.  He said said it looks like less that 3/16&#34; now (after steaming) so it is in tolerance so there is nothing they can do about it.  The next guy came and replaced the door but not the gasket and there was no improvement (still off 1/4&#34; to 5/16&#34;).  I had them come out again but they never called so the appointment never happened.  I contacted Customer Relations instead of Repair and they said I needed to have a tech come out to verify the doors not fitting right, they cannot be repaired, and to give the case number and phone number to the tech so they could call and initiate a return.  The first (rude) tech came out and after I told him he had been out three weeks earlier, he corrected me and said he was never at my home (obvious lie).  Then, even though he said he was never at my home and had yet to see the refrigerator, he said he already called tech support and they said they are not going to do anything about it.  I said informed him of the call with Customer Relations that he needed to verify the difference in the doors, see if it can be fixed, and call the number and let them know what you found.  He let me know that he is not going to do any of that because they already determined that GE is not going to do anything.  I let the Customer Relations person know and they sounded like they were surprised/disappointed it went that way.  Next appointment, the tech acknowledged the doors are off, they cannot be repaired and he was going to call the number as provided.  He explained that they changed the manufacturing process and the refrigerators have no frame...they are just injected with foam and how every they line up is what they are.  He said it used to be they could repair these but now they cannot be fixed, whereas they could be previously.  Next up, an email from GE Customer Relations stating that TAG (whatever that is) said, the twisted refrigerator and the doors that don't align (my words) are cosmetic issues and are not covered by warranty.  I would not expect it to be a warranty issue as it was shipped as a manufacturer' defect.  By the way, the ice maker drops ice in the freezer compartment continuously.  I see GE has no interest in quality or employing anyone from the United States.  They just sell their garbage here."

B00GJ2D1N6,"AKDY New 30"" European Style Island Mount Stainless Steel Range Hood Vent Touch Sensor Control W/Both Side Accessible Control AZ-H603B-75",Major Appliances,3,"This is the most disappointed that I've ever been with an Amazon product.  The instructions were written by someone with very little working of the English language (US English anyway).  None of the parts are labeled, although there are crude diagrams in the instructions.  There are 2 sets of some parts because the hood is adjustable to the ceiling; but they don't clearly mark which ones to use in which sequence.  I wound up putting most parts on at least twice before I got them right.  I ordered the optional charcoal filters for a ventless installation.  The hood instructions had nothing for ventless installation, and the filters came with no instructions at all.<br /><br />The product does look good once you work thru the installation, it is nosier than expected (other reviewers said this).  It's a shame that this company will not invest in a technical writer.<br /><br />Examples in Manual:<br /> - Title: &#34;Cooker Hood&#34;<br /> - Fix the A and B on the Blower Box assembly, show as the picture.  (In other words, study the picture closely and figure it out yourself.<br /> - As per the screw positions on the Upper support frame, drill 4 holes, then fill the Expanding Rubber into the holes.  Aiming the holes on the ceiling, fix the ceiling cover with the expanding screws tightly and make sure it is firm.  (this is the complete instructions for mounting the plate to the ceiling; the hood comes with plastic molly to mount it to a sheetrock ceiling - 'expanding rubber' is the plastic molly)."

B003O4FR2A,Samsung RF267AERS 26 cu. Ft. French Door Refrigerator - Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,1,"5 years of ownership and this fridge started leaking water all over our newly (6 weeks in and they're damaged) installed hardwood floors.  Not to mention the increasingly loud noises it started making after the 2nd year plus the malfunctioning ice dispenser. Disconnected the waterline and it's still leaking. Ugh. And Of course, our Service warranty had run out at the 5 year mark...6 weeks ago. Let's hope the repair bill comes back at a reasonable cost because we now have to have our floors resanded.  Why can't an appliance last for even 5 years?  We won't be buying another Samsung appliance after also experiencing issues with our washer and dryer!!!!!"

B00CXNLJ5M,"Bosch SHP65T55UC 500 24"" Stainless Steel Fully Integrated Dishwasher - Energy Star",Major Appliances,2,"I am frustrated with having to wash so many of my dishes, pots, and pans by hand because they don't fit together in the Bosch.  Here's a clue, the instruction book shows two suggested loading patterns for the dishwasher.  They are almost identical to each other and you will note that no pots, pans, large serving dishes, lids, or anything but a set of shallow dishes is shown.  It seems whoever designed the bottom rack wanted to fit in as many as possible of flat plates and almost flat bowls along with some silverware and that's it.  The immovable, closely spaced, angled prongs do not allow much else to fit in unless it lays on top of the prongs (and is subjected to over two hours of rubbing by the prongs).  Also, there is a vent on the left side that must not be blocked, so cutting boards, lids, cookie sheets and such cannot go there.  The silverware basket stops a few inches short of the length of the right side, and in the awkward space that is left practically nothing will fit because there is just an open space in the rack (no floor) so anything that might fit just in that space would fall through.  And the angled prongs just outside of that space don't let much reach past them.  I hate always having that big empty hole when there are so many things left to get in the dishwasher.<br />  What do you do if your plates and bowls are not shallow enough for the prongs?---You have to space them 2, 3, or even 4 prongs apart, fitting far too few in, and having them lean on each other, even though the instructions say to avoid having contact points between dishes.<br />  The middle rack is fine, except my model has no clips to hold in plastic lids, cups, etc.  It does adjust in height very easily and can hold my tall glasses.  The top rack is a great addition, and though I worried things wouldn't get clean enough up there, I needn't have.  Be aware that the &#34;auto&#34; setting takes 2 hours and 9 minutes to wash a load.  If there is no rinse aid in the dispenser, the sensor will increase the time to 2 hours and 35 minutes.<br />  In fact, using the Auto setting, the Bosch has cleaned every challenging dish I have been able to load in it, and done so very quietly.  But there are so many I can't load in it!<br />  Also, there is a strong “industrial” odor that hasn't gone away in over a month.  I hate having to keep it propped open to let it air out.<br />  Finally, it's very hard to get finger prints off the outside's stainless steel finish.  My KitchenAid stainless steel refrigerator can be quickly wiped, and all prints are gone.  This Bosch dishwasher takes a lot of scrubbing just to lessen the bad appearance of every touch.<br />  If you get this dishwasher, I suggest you save the bottom rack from your old dishwasher on the chance it will fit in this one."

There was shipping damage from being dropped to the left rear corner, which appears to be cosmetic. As others have stated, the bottom Styrofoam is simply not thick enough at 1/2&#34; to protect a seventy pound product. The cushioning needs to be at least an inch thick and preferably inch and a half. The mfg is ignoring the problem and might be saving ten cents in the process. The unit is noisy when running, but does cool to advertised temperatures. I would not buy another one except from a retail outlet, where it could be inspected before purchase."

Washer didn't work from day one.  I now entered the Samsung merry-go-round.  I was told that under no circumstances would Samsung replace the washer or refund my money until their &#34;process&#34; was complete.  That process involved 7 service calls and the replacement of every electronic component except the motor.  The repairman finally gave up.  On August 10, 2015 I received a refund check.  10 weeks without a washing machine.<br /><br />My issue is not that the machine didn't work.  The issue is how Samsung handles the problem.  This problem was identical to a service issue I had with a Samsung TV.  The Samsung &#34;process&#34; insures the consumer will be inconvenienced as much as possible.  Having spent 10 weeks without a washer and after spending hours on the phone and rearranging my schedule to have 7 service calls I can safely suggest  it would be easier to wash your clothes over a rock on the river than buy a Samsung product."

Good luck washing your expensive clothes in this thing, it will ruin them.

Good luck adding a shirt if you forgot, no dice, the unit will stay locked after start until the finish of the cycle. Absolutely worthless.

We bought one when we built our new house along with several other Kitchenaid and other stainless steel appliances.  We liked the idea of 2 drawers since there are mainly just 2 of us and we could wash small loads without wasting too much.  Great idea.  Awful machine.  We've had it for almost 6 years now and it's been repaired at least 2 times each year.  The air duct bezels in the front of the drawers break regularly - leaking water onto the floor until replaced.  I keep 3 or 4 in stock since the unit is worthless without them and the little plastic legs break off of them in 6 - 8 months of use.  I've also replaced the dryer fan and the wash pump.  This unit should be avoided at all costs.  It's an expensive boat anchor."

B00I9F063O,"Golden Vantage Stainless Steel 36"" Euro Style Island Mount Range Hood LCD Screen GV-GL-9002-36",Major Appliances,1,I was extremely dissapointed in this hood.  I received it but wasn't ready to install it yet.  I finally got around to doing so and realized that it only has supports on one side of the stack that goes to the ceiling.  To explain this better there is a square stack that goes to the ceiling.  Since this is square there are 4 corners going up.  There were only metal support beams in two of the corners that conneted to eachother on the way up.  It seems to me that each corner should have a support beam so that the support sytem is a square just like the outer stainless steel.  I was immidiatly concerned that this could not possibly create a secure and stable installation.  I continued with the instalaltion and as I expected there was a lot of play in the hood.  It was able to rock a good 3 to 4 inches with very little pressure applied ot it.  When I turned it on the motor made a lot of noise including a loud clicking sound.  I then tried the lights which really didn't do anything to light up the cooking space below.  I returned this to Amazon on the basis of the obviously broken motor.  By the time I was able to uninstall this and pack it up it was past the 30 day return windows but Amazon was great and took the return anyway.<br /><br />I went to my local Best Buy and purchased a hood from them.  It cost double the price but I got a much better hood.  The hood I purchased had supports on both sides of the stack.  I installed this and it was as sturdy as can be.  I could lean on it and it won't move at all. This is what I had expected.  I did some research and it seems Golden Vantage makes a wall mount hood that is identical.  My best guess is they took that hood and  put a ceiling mount bracket on the top.  Very very poor design.

I've noticed a lot of reviewers complaining about the handle. The manufacturers must have taken note because the one I got is not a &#34;turn&#34; handle, it's a very durable pull handle. I was surprised by how solid this thing is built, and it fits six cans perfectly. I wanted it for my cube at work. I took some pictures, I'm going to see if I can add them."
B00AB51CUG,"AKDY 30"" Kitchen Wall Mount Stainless Steel Touch Panel Control Range Hood AZ63175S Stove Vents",Major Appliances,2,"Just installed this unit. I have installed many similar range hoods all purchased from ebay or amazon, and while this looks as good as the others, it is obsurdly loud. Really Really, wall shaking, low hum with cyclone noise loud. And ontop of that,the lights are an uglycolor and completely useless brightness. They aren't bulbs either, you have to replace the whole unit, which in my experience is very expensive.  The final straw is that the touch controls make no sense.  Regretting not repurchasing one of the models i liked in the past. Im thinking about returning it, but im not confident in the refund process speed."

B0051QJ478,LG LSC27925ST26.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Side-By-Side Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"We've experienced the same ice maker issue everyone else complains of. It is a defective design and as stated by others, LG will not do anything to resolve without cost to the buyer for repair. Our freezer at times looks like a glacier with all the overrun water from the ice tray which does not dump out the already made ice. We are then forced to chisel away at the ice to get to items stored in the freezer. This is problem has been going on since the fridge was barely a year old."
B004N4MSPO,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"This dishwasher changed my life! I love it and would recommend it to anyone who needs a small dishwasher for an apartment, or efficiency space. It can do full size frying pans and we usually end up running one or two loads a day. One for cups, bowls and plates, and one for pots and pans.<br /><br />Tip: Make sure you're regularly cleaning the filter and strainer. If the filter mess gets too gunked up, you'll end up with spotty grimy dishes. I'd also recommend a rinse additive with use like Jet Dry."

Delivery was good, they took them out of the boxes and put them in place inside the house, which was fantastic.  The reason I only gave them three stars has nothing to do with the items themselves, they are wonderful, and I have had no issues to date, and have always loved LG washing machines that I have had in the past, the MAJOR issue  I had was when we tried to connect everything, the dryer did not come with a plug!  I had to run out to a store to get a plug and then hire an electrician to actually install it as I was not about to take the chance that I did something wrong and wrecked the dryer.  It was still cheaper, but the frustration and days it took to wait for an electrician was really annoying.  A heads up would have been nice either in the description or as soon as ordered so that you know what you are getting."

It came fully assembled and ready to go, literally just plugged it in and put food in it. I'd definitely recommend this."

The controls are a little quirky, you have to put a &#34;0&#34; in front of the timer to set minutes but not all the time took some getting used to. The only real design flaw is that, unlike most microwaves where you push a button and the door pops open, you have to pull the handle on this one. And the machine is so small and light that you need two hand to open the door or the whole thing moves around and doesn't open. This can be a pain. But if you need this size, the cooking is fine."

B00KO95RVO,Whynter Stainless Steel Cigar Cooler Humidor,Major Appliances,4,"I was tired of constantly monitoring humidity and tweaking my box humidors.  Summer in Houston is HOT and keeping the house at a constant 70 degrees is not an option.  All that said I broke down and bought this about a week ago.  I had always wiped my humidors with distilled water to season, but recently read an article about NOT wiping them, but letting them come to proper humidity with a cup of distilled water or beads or Bovida packs.  I had all three so I put them all in and plugged in my new cigar cooler.  In two days the humidity was at 62%  I went ahead and loaded about forty cigars in it (I bought two Spanish cedar trays to go in it too at 7&#34; x 10&#34; x 2&#34; from amazon and it works very well).  I must say, it is whisper quiet and a nice looking unit.  I had one problem.  One of the screws they sent to fasten the door to the unit was NOT threaded.  Pretty funny, especially after trying to get the screw started over and over only to pull it out and see no threads.  Not the reason for the four star rating.  I emailed them and they are sending me the screw.  The four stars is only because I have had it for less than two weeks.  If it continues to function properly for another month, I will go five stars for sure.  So far, I am very pleased with my purchase.  That said.....like others said, get the larger one, I should have."

B00MHY0B9C,DMAFRIGFGID2466QF - Frigidaire Gallery 24 Built-In Dishwasher,Major Appliances,1,"We've owned our dishwasher for 2 years and have had nothing but trouble from it. It washes about half of the dishes properly,  every time. I have to use extra chemicals in every wash to even be able to use one dish from each load. We've had to deal with error after error and each part is super expensive. A small storm blew the electrical panel. The vent decided to stop closing. You name it, it's gone wrong. I can't wait for it to fully bite the dust so I can replace it. I wish I had the money to get a new one now so I could throw this piece of garbage in the street."
B00U7XIS86,Samsung RF23J9011SR 22.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,4,"This review is for the Samsung counter depth refrigerator model number RF23J9011SR/AA.<br />*** UPDATED 9/28/15 with photos***<br />***UPDATED with some newly found issues: 8/19/15***<br /><br />We've had this refrigerator for about two weeks. Overall, we absolutely love it. We are a family of 4. We do not stock up on food. We tend to shop several times a week as we live very close to a grocery store. So the counter depth design not only looks great, it has plenty of space for us. So much so, that we have yet to come close to filling it. I believe it would be fine for families of our size that tend to stock up. The refrigerator section is wide and shallow keeping everything within easy reach and view. Hopefully this will cut down on forgotten leftovers hidden in the back that come to resemble biological experiments. The ice maker makes ice cubes at a rate that is on par with every other ice maker on the market including Sub-Zero (I'm getting about 160 cubes/day). The French door freezer design was my #1 reason for purchasing it. Each side of the freezer has two good-sized pull out drawers, a top pull out shelf and shelves in the door to keep everything organized. Each side of the freezer can be set to a different temperature. We use one side as a standard freezer for things like frozen veggies. The other side we set to &#34;Soft Freeze&#34; and use for meat, fish, and sandwich meat. The food doesn't freeze solid, but is kept really cold and fresh! So we gain more refrigerator space as we don't store any meat in that section. I love not having one, giant freezer drawer so that I don't have to bend over and dig for frozen food. Freezers with one big drawer also collect debris on the bottom: crumbs and hair. Yuk!<br /><br />There are a few, annoyances that, all tolled, keep me from giving it 5 stars:<br />1) The doors are not smudge/fingerprint free and require frequent wiping.<br />2) The recessed door handles, while they look stylish, are a bit of a pain. You can't grab them naturally with either hand. My 10 year old son was the first to point this out. You either have to open the right door with your left hand and vice versa or you have to twist your right hand with your thumb pointing down to open the right doors and similarly with the left.<br />3) None of the drawers pull out far enough. They all have a stop which I feel is too short.<br />4) This one is probably the biggest issue for me: With the ice dispense in crushed ice mode, a lot of crushed ice flies all over the floor unless you have a very wide mug or wide mouthed glass that are pressed right up to the opening. For normal sized glasses, ice goes all over.<br />5) There is a function on the control panel to lock it out so that someone can't change settings by accident (say, inadvertently touch the freezer temp control and change it). When I use that, then the ice and water dispenser stop working!!<br /><br />I'll be contacting Samsung about items 4 and 5 for sure. Hopefully they are defects that can be addressed with a service call. Lastly, and this one is very very minor, while it is generally very quite, it does emit a gurgling sound on occasion. I know for sure that it is not the water line because it made that sound before we even hooked it up.<br /><br />To address some issues I've read about in other reviews (from many different sites)<br />Issue 1) &#34;It only lasted a year and a half.&#34;: 2015 is the first year this model was released and there were no previous versions of it. So these reviews must be for the non-counter depth version of this model. The /AA in the model number indicates country of manufacture which is the USA. So the AA is not a version indicator.<br /><br />Issue 2) &#34;The outside sweats and drips water all over the floor.&#34;: The manual clearly states that if this happens, turn off the &#34;Energy Saver Mode.&#34; This could happen in humid environments.<br /><br />Issue 3) &#34;Ice cube making rate is slow.&#34;: There are severalissues here clearly addressed in the manual. First, upon installation, it may take several days before it makes ice cubes at its normal rate. Secondly, the rate is dependent upon the temperature to which you have the freezer set. Initially, our freezer was set to 0 degrees Fahrenheit and the rate was slow. I set it to -2 and am getting a rate of about 140-160 cubes per day which is the same as every other refrigerator on the market.<br /><br />Issue 4) &#34;You can't pull out the ice maker bucket to access the ice cubes en bulk.&#34; This one is just not true. Maybe they didn't pull hard enough or they are talking about a different model.<br /><br />About the attached photos: Upper section: There are about 20 condiment bottles on the 2 top-right door shelves alone with room for a couple more. The pot on the bottom-left is an 8.5 quart Calphalon dutch oven. The bottom-right shelf has 3 half-gallon milk containers, 1 one-gallon milk jug, a 90 oz jug of OJ and several other assorted bottles of water and gatorade. Egg cartons fit nicely under the icemaker. Bottom section: Bottom-right: Set to chill. We use it for meats, beer and other adult bevs we like ice cold. Bottom-left is freezer. Mostly frozen veggies and ice cream.issues here clearly addressed in the manual. First, upon installation, it may take several days before it makes ice cubes at its normal rate.

B00LG5IIEI,"SPT UF-214SS Energy Star Upright Freezer, 2.1 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,1,"The freezer arrived dented; however, instead of returning it, I opted for the (more convenient) option of accepting a discount -- the dent appeared cosmetic in nature. Fast forward 8 months - the day before my wife and I planned to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. Whilst packing for our romantic getaway, I went to retrieve the top tier of wedding cake - carefully and lovingly saved to celebrate our first year of marriage. The cake had been sitting in the freezer for many months. To my horror, I found the freezer filled with mold and rotting food. The freezer had died (seemingly just a few weeks before). A tragic story indeed, but more tragic given that the freezer was 8 months old, and failed in such a catastrophic manner. I plan to replace this freezer, but this time, I will carefully research (and consider more expensive and more reliable) options -- an 8 month lifespan is clearly reflective of compromised workmanship and quality."
B004SUXZ5U,Avanti 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Counter Top Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,4,"My product arrived, undamaged, no dents in the box, no broken glass, and absolutely perfect. I first tried to squeeze this into a small corner which I thought would be perfect in the kitchenwrong! The manual states to give it 5&#34; of breathing room around the sides and boy are they not joking. Your cooler will not be able to go sub 61 degrees if you don't give it breathing room. Upon moving it to another place, the temperature immediately started dropping and my fridge thermometer was reporting the same. The fan is not loud as other reviewers state. The noise it produces is half (probably more) of what a refrigerator generates. I have it fairly close to my couch and unless your place is whisper quiet, you will not notice it. It will be like white noise in the background. The heat from my radiator is louder than the whisper this produces.

B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,4,"This is a 1 week review on the Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker.<br />Pros:<br />*The ice maker was easy to set up out of the box, could have done without even reading the instructions.<br />*Ice makes in as little as 6 minutes if you use the small bullets, 13 minutes if you use the large bullets. I personally found the small bullets to be too small and they melted too fast, but part of that is that I don't leave air-conditioning running during the day.<br />*As the ice melts in the machine the water is recycled back into the water reservoir to be refroze.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Bucket is small only holds enough ice for one or two glasses<br />*Ice can't really be moved to freezer for later use because it freezes into a big lump. (I knew this going into it and was ok with it though.)<br />*The machine can be a bit noisy, don't know how it compares to any other machine though.<br /><br />At this point in time I am happy with my purchase."

B00MB39X02,W3038 | Miele 24 Front Load Washer - White,Major Appliances,5,"It's a fabulous washing machine.  It's optimal for people who want a washing machine near the living space or bedrooms of the home - because it's so quiet.  If you have a huge house and your washing machine is far from everything else (i.e., basement or garage or distant utility room), then you don't need this.  Of course, this is European sized, meaning small by American standards.  If you're willing to break up your laundry into multiple loads or do laundry more frequently, then you'll be fine.  This machine is amazing.  I hardly notice that it's running at all.  Even when it's spinning, it's surprisingly quiet and causes much less vibration than other machines.  It spins so quickly that nearly all of the water is wrung from the clothes by the time it's done.  After your last load for the day, be sure to sop up the water that remains in the rubber door-sealing lip, and leave the door open for 12 hours to dry out.  It's also a good idea to remove the detergent tray after use and place it on top of the machine until next use or until it's dried out anyway.  I've never used a washer I liked more than this one."

Usually dries everything in 30-60 minutes, blankets may take 2 hours. Combines perfectly with the Panda washer/spin dryer. Make sure you use the spin dryer before putting things into this dryer though. Sheets fit into the Panda washer spin dryer but blankets won't, so you may have to squash the excess water out of them with your shoes in the bathtub before putting them into this dryer."
B002UQ107O,Granite Grabbers Dishwasher Mounting Brackets,Major Appliances,2,"Held for about 90 days then popped off. The seller included instructions that were very detailed and specific. While those instructions were helpful, they propose a level of effort/skill/tools most buyers may not be aware of needing. For example, you need vices/clamps to hold the item in place while drying."

B0084IY1ZU,Samsung 4.2 cu. ft. High-Efficiency Top-Load Washer - White,Major Appliances,1,"DO NOT BUY!! DO NOT BUY!! Don't waste your money! I've had nothing but problems. First, the bottom part broke and water was everywhere causing hundreds of dollars of repair to the laundry room. They said it was not part of the 10 year warranty! Now, the washer would not spin leaving all the clothes wet. I've only had it for less than 3 years. It's a terrible machine for such a high price. Samsung washers are bad products. My friend has a similar Samsung machine and it's broken too."

Installed easily and works great. I thought there was a bit of a &#34;plastic&#34; taste to the water at first, but after running some water thru the system (less than a gallon) it was perfect. I liked the fact that the filter comes sealed in a plastic cover. It seems to allow a faster flow of water than the original too. This is my choice from now on."

B0074Y2FPI,"Whirlpool WOD51EC0AS 30"" Stainless Steel Electric Double Wall Oven",Major Appliances,1,"Self-cleaning cycle shuts off power and locks door until repairman fixes it; and then it does it again. Whirlpool has a well known design problem with their wall ovens (google self-cleaning cycle and problems). The first time that I ran the self-cleaning cycle the door shut and the power turned off and could not be turned on again. After a wait of several weeks for a repairman, who came without any parts and had to come back again, the control board and thermal fuse were replaced and I could use the ovens again UNTIL I ran the self-cleaning cycle again. What a surprise, exactly the same problem again. I intend to keep on running the self-clean cycle immediately the ovens are repaired and see what happens. Whirlpool has had this problem for years but has done nothing about it."

We've had it just less than 3 months and the whites side which we kept at 48° now will only cool to 64°.  The red side has been kept at 64° and maintains that just fine.  Unfortunately I've tried an experiment and flip flopped the wine and am seeing if the red side will cool to 48° now.  Frustrating!"

B00AW04ZMM,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine 7.9-15lbs with Spin Cycle …,Major Appliances,5,"Right now I'm living in a house that has a washer and dryer hookup but I'm about to be downsizing to an apartment. Because of this I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a standard washer and dryer only to have no place to put it later. I read tons about this product and watched YouTube videos by alaskagranny before deciding to purchase one. This little washer is a powerhouse!! I actually don't mind doing laundry now when I used to hate it before. I've tested the limits of this little guy and found that although it's not recommended, it'll wash a queen sized duvet cover in a pinch! The spinner compartment holds more than you think it will but by packing it full, the clothes don't come out as dry. I spent the first few weeks learning just how big a load I could do without having to spin in multiple batches. I went to Walmart and purchased a large metal foldable drying rack before actually ordering the Panda lol! Once purchased I had it set up in the kitchen and used the hose it comes with. Afterwards I decided to put it in the laundry room and buy a washer hose hookup because the plastic hose it comes with cant handle high water pressure and makes filling up take longer. since using the washer hose, I can knock out a load of laundry much faster just from cutting down fill time. TIPS:: 1) Wash towels MAX 2 at a time and spin one at a time. 2) spin smaller loads to get more water out so they dry faster 3) don't put the drain hose up too high or it will not drain properly and will take forever 4) before hanging to dry, shake the crap out of everything that leaves the spinner. doing this, I have no issues with wrinkles! however hard you shake clothes, shake towels twice as hard! 5) ****I recommend spinning between the wash cycle and rinse cycle as this helps remove all of the soap and prevent your clothes from being crunchy!***** 6) I use powdered Gain and I use about a teaspoon+ per load give or take. and I use maybe a tablespoon of fabric softener in the rinse cycle.Follow these tips for a VERY satisfactory time using the Panda!  UPDATE 8-11-15: I tried the rinsing in the spinner method as indicated by another user and wow!! It works so well! Definitely use whatever method works for you and your situation. Rinsing while in the spinner is definitely at your own risk because the instruction state NOT to put water in the spinner, however there's an inlet on that side so obviously the originally intended it for that purpose."
B00IQACMK2,"Samsung RS25H5111SR Energy Star 24.5 Cu. Ft. Side-by-Side Refrigerator/Freezer with External Water/Ice Dispenser and In-Door Ice Maker, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,3,Medium size refrigerator but feels very compact . I bought this because Consumer Reports gave it high reviews. Unfortunately I don't think they actually used the refrigerator in a home setting. In a bright lit lab with lots of florescent lighting I'm sure it is fine but the ice/ water button are on a black screen outside of the display panel and are difficult to see. The inside of the refrigerator has one center light and the refrigerator is dark inside. Sorry I went by Consumer Report choice.

B002C8HR9A,The Laundry Alternative Wonderwash Non-electric Portable Compact Mini Washing Machine,Major Appliances,2,"This thing doesn't use electricity. That's awesome, but I replaced this machine with another laundry alternative product. Here's why.<br /><br />-The suction feet on the bottom work so well that it's difficult to get the little machine off the base of your shower/tub when you want to empty it without the clips holding it together popping off. I used a credit card to pop it up at first, but eventually just made slits in the suction cups so they didn't work anymore, but still gripped because they're soft rubber. That worked just fine. No need for sticking them so hard to anything. Ever.<br /><br />-My first machine was defective. I heard a &#34;squealing&#34; sound. It was air escaping because the bottom piece had not been properly glued on. It eventually popped off, but they sent a new machine immediately, so it must have been a dud.<br /><br />-For some reason, I found this thing laborious. Put clothes in. Add water from bucket since it doesn't line up under the faucet/it gets really heavy when it fills halfway. Lid on. Turn a lot of times. Lid off. Drain. Add water to rinse. Lid on. Turn a lot of times. Lid off. Drain. Squeeze clothes out to hang (before I got the little dryer...which is amazing). It felt like it took forever and my back hurt from being bent over it constantly.<br /><br />-It's literally held together with a few plastic clips and a metal clip on either side. That's it. It gets pretty heavy when it's full of water and clothes and cannot take any serious movement any way or another before those little clips start popping out. I recommend gluing them in if you aren't going to be taking it apart for any reason.<br /><br />Anyway, like I said, I used this for about a month before switching to another product which did the washing for me and didn't quite as much babysitting. It clearly works for some people, but I don't have time for all that."

B010DR6EJU,Samsung RF26HFENDWW 25.5 Cu. Ft. White French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,2,"rf26hfendww. We've had it about a month, hinged flap that's supposed to seal the gap between the doors won't open when left door is closed. Left door to which the flap is hinged can't be adjusted for height to make the little lever at the top ride high enough to open the flap. Samsung chat help doesn't seem to have a fix although same problem is stated in several online reviews. Easy to not notice this problem - my guess is a lot of people who own this fridge don't realize it's NOT sealing due to this design flaw.The flap should open when you close the left door in order to seal the gap between the doors. Chat help staff seem to have no clue except sending a link to the same manual.   Door alarm doesn't work as near as I can tell, but then it's not mentioned in the manual so it's hard to determine what it's supposed to do. User's manual is petty poor, full of errors and missing information. Fridge is nice and big, but there's a lot of wasted space in the door shelves - you could fit a couple more shelves in at the bottom but it's not configured for it. As a result there's unused space between the produce drawers and the bottom of the doors when closed. Well lit. Various labels on top edge of freezer drawer are visible when fridge is closed, and UPC label on left sidewall shows unless fridge is installed flush."

I've always been pleased with this machine, does what it is supposed to do.<br />Recently it has started shutting off unexpectedly whilst making ice, I need to troubleshoot that.  But hey!  It has literally made over a thousand pounds of ice, and if you figure 20 pounds is $5 per bag, this machine has paid for itself more than twice."

B00OGL9PVY,"The Laundry Alternative Miniwash Portable, Compact Mini Washing Machine (Pink) with 3 Year Full Warranty",Major Appliances,4,"The machine I have is the older, clear version, not the present one.<br /><br />I like this machine. It does feel a bit cheap, but I think it is entirely worth it to avoid the laundromat. It holds a good amount of clothes for me (2 pairs of pants, a few shirts and socks or three towels) and I can wash sheets. I threw away the tube that is supposed to attach to the faucet because it felt flimsy and plastic. I did not trust it to not pop off and get water everywhere. I used a shower head that can lower into the reservoir to fill it. There is no way to stop the timer once you start it, so if you've set it for 15 minutes, it's stuck on that time unless you unplug it. The machine needs a bit of babysitting, as others have said, as you have to drain it and fill it again to rinse the clothes. That's not a big deal to me. I use this with the dryer from Laundry Alternative as well."

So samsung loses a star for having unqualified customer support person. That wasted a day of mine.."
B00KO95RVO,Whynter Stainless Steel Cigar Cooler Humidor,Major Appliances,1,"Update 4/17.... Continues to be garbage. I unplugged this overpriced mini-fridge because it kept dropping in temperature. I plugged it back in after a bit because I as having difficulty maintaining humidity (about 60). After a few days I unplugged it again because now it keeps dropping temps to 55-degrees. I guess if you were in the Sahara Desert this would be a valuable purchase. Otherwise, STAY AWAY from this... Downgrading from 2 stars to 1, only because I can't give it 1/10th of one star...<br /><br />Older post... Looks good... Makes a lot of noise oddly enough... Optimal temp for storage is 70 degrees, highest set-point on this unit is 66 (although it won't maintain 66, but does keep it at 65). Must open door 180 degrees to slide out tray, so you must store in a spot that allows door to completely open 180-degrees. Comes with dial hygrometer, not optimal digital. Nice enough unit, wouldn't do it again given the opportunity."

B00KY5V4M4,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine with Spin Dryer,Major Appliances,1,"I bought this in hopes of saving money so I wouldn't have to pay for a full size washer and I was hoping to cut back on costs overall. What was a positive in price it made up for (negatively)  in hassle. Granted I didn't do my full research, which I now regret, it's a lot of work to fill up if you don't have easy access to a faucet. It takes forever and for the life of me I can't get it to drain all the way. Within weeks of getting it it started leaking an absurd amount of water all over the floor. I go through two bath towels just during the wash cycle. I have no idea where the water is leaking from. I would not recommend this to anyone. Pay the extra money for a washer that goes all the way through the cycle on its own. It will save you a lot of frustration and pay for itself."

The machine has no problem, it is still in perfect condition: powerful, quiet, and no leaking.  Someone complained the noisy, try to put it on a cushioned surface.  Works well with a spin dryer.  In my particular case, I prefer no-auto, so I can control the time of washing and spinning by minutes and even seconds.  I wash items made of 100% wool, silk, linen in this mini washer and use spin dryer.  Auto washer will be too rough on these materials.  Also the clothing is much clean by using the mini because small load.  The mini washer is not for someone who just wants to throw the stuff in and walk away."
B00GLQDIUG,Amana ABB2224BRB 21.9 Cu. Ft. Black Bottom Freezer Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,5,I have had this refrigerator for around 10 years now.  Never had to have a single repair.  I love how everything is adjustable to fit my needs.<br />It's very easy to keep clean - all the shelves and drawers come out for easy cleaning.  The freezer on the bottom makes such total sense.  You go to the freezer much less often than the fridge - so there is much less bending down to find something on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator.<br />The only drawback - no ice maker.  I have no complaints about this little workhorse.
B00197E3TC,"Ice O Matic IFI4C In-Line Ice-O-Matic Filter, 1/4"" Size",Major Appliances,5,"I use these filters on my commercial ice machine at my restaurant.  They are a little expensive but when you have a $5k ice machine, you'll  want to pay a little more for a better quality filter. Be sure to follow the maintenance recommendations for your specific machine.  If it calls for filter replacements every 3 months, then do it.  A $70 filter replaced on schedule is much cheaper than a $2500 unscheduled repair billI."
B000N4NO4C,EdgeStar Portable Stainless Steel Ice Maker,Major Appliances,4,"I &#34;like&#34; this ice maker. It keeps my freezer filled with ice, but I highly question the &#34;poundage&#34; calculation that the advertisement says it can make on a daily basis. This would be under the assumption that you run it 24 hours a day while emptying the ice bucket as it will stop producing ice when it is full. So don't get this ice machine based on the amount it says it can make. I use it moderately for a 4 person family and run it consistently when guests are here just to keep the freezer replenished. With that being said, The ice tastes deliciously pure because i use purified water. It does have 3 sizes to choose from of bullet shaped ice with a hole that goes to the top but not completely through. Because of that, the ice will melt faster in a drink than a solid piece of ice. Which I don't mind. The ice maker itself is very durable. It is tall and you must have room to let the fan breathe or it will get to hot and it will take longer to make the ice and can ruin the machine itself. Overall I give it a rating of 4 stars because it suits my needs but is not perfect."

It's a very basic unit that I bought to use for a year or two while I save up to put a new kitchen in my apartment. I'll have no qualms about throwing in the trash at that point, because it's not very pleasant to use. The door is very stiff and clunks noisily closed. It's almost impossible to see through the window to check if your milk is boiling over for example.

The stainless racks have to be removed and don't clean easily. The oven light burned out and is extremely difficult to change it was designed by idiots not engineers. In the process it damaged the printed circuit board which would have cost more to replace than getting a new Whirlpool oven which was recommended by consumer digest.

B00INSGXF2,U-Line : BI98B-00 15 Ice Maker,Major Appliances,1,"I did not buy this product from Amazon, but wanted to weigh in on my experience to hopefully prevent someone else from making the same mistake of purchasing this item.  It was purchased in june 2009 as a source of extra ice for summer use. It stopped working thankfully within the warranty period.  The warranty covered the repair with no cost to me as advertised.  It is advertised to produce 25 lbs of ice per day, but mine could not even produce that amount in a week.  The older it became the less ice it produced to a point that it would not produce a full bin within a month.  Needless to say I have long since given up on the unit and now it just sits in a corner unplugged.  Now when i turn it on, the compressor starts and immediately shuts down,  probably a fatal condition.  In retrospect for the amount of money spent on this unit, I could have had a full size refrigerator/freezer that produced ice regularly.  Without question this is the worst product I have ever purchased!"

Top Loading Portable Washing Machine, White",Major Appliances,5,"2nd update I finally figured out how to talk to the manufacturer and was offered a refund and then I figured out what was wrong with the washer...I had washed coins and they got somewhere they shouldn't have. When they finally worked their way out the noise stopped and everything has been fine since then and I'm happy again  UPDATED REVIEW I have had this washer for 5 months and it is making very bad noise as if I'm washing my husbands tools in it. I have contacted seller who says they can't help me that I should contact manufacturer. The manufacturer doesn't answer their phones and they don't return phone calls when you leave messages.  My advice is don't buy one of these machines.  This little washing machine is doing a good job for us, we live in travel trailer last washer shook the trailer when it was running and we don't seem to notice it with this one and we paid $200.00 less for this machine than the last one that didn't last three years. It did come with dents which don't really bother me because it sits in a closet, seller did make a satisfactory settlement with me. Note to seller maybe some packing should be placed around the tub because it appears that the tub bangs around during shipping and knocks the dents from the inside of the cabinet out. The only thing I don't like is that it has preset programs, I really wish they would make one that you manually set it to do what you want, suppose I'm showing my age cause I don't like all this digital stuff."
B00HH2YZT6,"Samsung RF32FMQDBSR 4-Door Refrigerator with Convertible Zone, 32 Cubic Feet",Major Appliances,1,"The level of disappointment I feel about my beautiful, albeit non repairable fridge will be very difficult to articulate.  I absolutely LOVED this fridge (until 7 days ago on it's 14 month anniversary) Suffice to say, the 4 months I took to meticulously research this exceedingly expensive purchase left me pondering the validity of unbiased, unpaid reviews.  I've come to the conclusion that your best avenue is not to purchase a product that has less than 3 years of reviews, and to thoroughly read through the reviews here on Amazon.  If you are mislead like I was into believing the product reviews on the manufacturer websites aren't filtered, you will be in the situation I am.<br /><br />Days if not weeks were saved by following the advice and clear explanation from other people here that have offered detailed reviews of the issues they experienced. (Thank you for posting) I will not go into technical detail about the upper fridge not cooling, or the flammable refrigerant used, nor the non repairable nature.  You can review all of those items by the other sorely disappointed customers that came before me (but not enough before me to alert me prior to my purchase). I encourage you to read through all of the 1 star reviews.<br /><br />However, what I will relay to you is the current debacle of attempting to get a refund for the boat anchor Samsung KNOWINGLY sold me.  In fact, when you finish reading this review I suggest you do a search about the Class Action Lawsuit against Samsung.  These issues have continued for the better part of 5 years on a variety of refrigerators they continue to sell without revisions.  This is a company who clearly wanted to build a better mousetrap and has seriously FAILED.  These are bad guys here folks..... they are taking our hard earned money in exchange for one of the most vital home appliances you will own, knowing it WILL fail.  Not IF... WHEN.  This unit was deemed unrepairable by Samsungs &#34;Authorized Repair Company&#34;  I was given a 7000 number.  Now... I'm on hold again.<br /><br />I'm listening to the on hold music now for about the 8th time on hold now for the Executive Customer Relations department.  Don't hold your breath while you wait, I've logged over an hour on hold so far today.  The total time dealing with this issue is 7 days without a working fridge, and around 20 hours on the phone.  Needless to say this fleecing has me irate.  I intend to receive a full refund, as well as the cost of the food destroyed by this defect.  I will become their worst nightmare until I receive it.  If I need to take legal action, I will... on principle alone.  Buyer Beware.  Don't be allured by the beauty- it's a mirage."

Door was assembled a bit crooked and overall quality is mediocre but looks good from a distance. Have had it about 5 weeks now and it is doing its job- drinks stay sufficiently cold, good capacity, internal fan helps a lot (main reason I bought it) and is quiet enough in my family room adjacent to my home theater setup. Stopped working once for some unknown reason (maybe got a bit hot as I have it installed in a tight cabinet space- IFU clearly says it is designed to be free-standing) but after unplugging and letting it sit for 30 mins, it started up again and has been fine ever since. I check the external cabinet temp regularly and while it does get quite warm to the touch, it seems to be okay installed as is. A good idea is to keep it out first time it cools down your drinks (it will work quite hard doing this), then when the compressor cycles off (ie- it has reached its set temp), you can push it back in.

After plugging in water supply, it started leaking on the left inside the refrigerator section. No ice or chilled water for two weeks until service showed up. Otherwise, it seems to work OK. I like the smaller ice cubes. It is definitely not as well-made as the 8yo LG French door it replaced. The water reservoir is very small. There are two fewer door bins and no egg/butter bin or wine bottle rack that my 2007 model had. The clear plastic door bins do not have any edge reinforcement, so longevity remains to be seen. But it looks nice.<br /><br />Note: Our local LG service is impossible to contact. They put you on hold for 15 minutes and then says the mailbox is full and it hangs up. LG corporate was able to get through in 12 minutes. Problem was a missing retainer clip on the tubing to the reservoir.  I would steer clear of LG until they can provide better quality control."

Thirty minutes after I plugged it in, I loaded the beverages, trying not to overfill it, but probably didn't a good job at that. I could tell after. Few hours that the beverages did block the air from circulating, just like the manual warned that it would. So I just drank the beverages from the back since they were colder. But after it cooled overnight, everything was nice and cold this morning. It does make some noise, but nothing unbearable. Overall, one day in, and I'm happy with my purchase."

B0015LWZLK,"Electrolux EW30GS65G 30"" Gas Slide-In Range with Wave-Touch Controls and Luxury-Glide Oven Racks,",Major Appliances,1,"This model has been discontinued by the manufacturer, probably because its extensive digital technology is damaged by heat, a point apparently overlooked by the stove’s architects, since the primary job of a stove is, after all, to produce heat.<br />The most irritating defect is the oven door precipitously locking on its own. It cannot be unlocked through the control pad, and necessitates a visit by a repair technician, who then needs to order new parts. This generally occurs when oven gets hot, but has also occurred when the stove has not been used at all.<br />During the 2-1/2 years I have owned this range, the door motor lock assembly has been replaced twice. The circuit board associated with the display has been replaced three times. I was advised by a technician during the one of the first year warranty period visits to: purchase an extended warranty, and never use the self-cleaning feature.<br />After finally coming to terms with the fact that I threw $2400 out the window and needed to replace this attractive but unreliable beast, I wrestled with the question of whether to sell, donate or recycle it. I contacted Electrolux to ask if they would transfer the extended warranty to a new user, and they absolutely refused, offering to cancel my extended warranty as their solution to my dissatisfaction with the stove.<br />My conscience would take too much of a beating if I were to even offer this thing as a donation, since it would likely precipitate hundreds of dollars of repairs and weeks of disuse to an unsuspecting buyer, so it’s being rendered unsellable and good for recycle of its metal only.<br />It goes without saying that I would never purchase another appliance manufactured by Electrolux or one of its subsidiaries."
B002UYSHMM,Haier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer,Major Appliances,5,"I've had this washer for about 10 months and so far I love it. It is very quiet and does a great job washing clothes. It spins better than ANY machine I've ever used. It spins so thoroughly , that the only problem you may encounter is  removing laundry quickly enough to avoid wrinkles. I considered getting a compact dryer but, this washer rinses and spins so well, I only need to hang the laundry on hangers over a doorway. They dry in a few hours. Except jeans of course. They take a bit longer.<br />All the connections work well and I have not needed to make adjustments or repairs. Occasionally, when I use the high water setting I will get a small bit of water on the floor. I believe that's my fault because I fill the clothes a bit too high. It never happens on medium water level. Its such a small amount that its easy to clean with a towel. I can't blame the machine for my mistake.<br />I highly recommend this machine.<br /><br />*UPDATE* 11/2016<br />I've had this machine for 2 years now and it is still working flawlessly. I've read some of the negative reviews and I'm updating because maybe I can help with some extra info.<br />First off, it's important to keep the wash loads small. This is the most important factor in success with this machine. If you overload it, you will have water overflow. You will also be stressing the machine, forcing it to work harder than it's intended to, resulting in problems.<br /><br />Second, regarding water level. AGAIN, don't overload the machine. ALSO, make sure you add the clothes BEFORE the water is full. If you want to add enough water to dilute your detergent or bleach (As I do), let it fill 3 or 4 inches and then get the clothes in there.<br />If you let the water reach it's level and then add the clothes, you are going to force the water over the top.So make sure to put the clothes in when the water level is still low. If you err on the side of caution and use smaller loads you will gradually figure out exactly how much you can put in one load."

B00IY7B5CS,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,1,"Works great at first then the fan started making noises when it spun.  yesterday the water indicator light came on saying there is no water but there was plenty of water in the reservior.  So the pump is somehow malfunctioning and not sucking the water in even when there is water.  I could tolerate the fan noises but if it doesn't suck water in, there is no ice.  The unit is not nonoperational.  $150 for a few months of ice is not good.  I would not recommend this unit."

B00ZZEFTPC,"Igloo 5.1 cu ft Chest Freezer, Black",Major Appliances,3,"CON: The most important thing to know about this chest freezer is someone typed a 1 instead of a 2 in the width section of dimensions, so instead of being 19&#34; wide like the description says everywhere we've looked--from Amazon to Walmart--the darn thing is actually 29&#34; wide. Like most people, we carefully chose where this sizable appliance would go, so being surprised with an almost extra foot in width was infuriating. Fortunately, we were able to make it work without it looking too horrible. Granted, where we had to put it doesn't look nearly as good as the planned 19&#34; would have, but since it's not enclosed by a wall or other appliance on either side, we, like I said, made it work and are living with it. Had we known the true measurements, however, we would have reconsidered making the purchase.  Con: Another really annoying thing is one of the big, ugly, yellow stickers on the side has proven impossible to remove. It's the cheapest, stickiest, nastiest type of sticker adhesive. It broke my nails, and my husband has thick nails, but he had no luck either. We're going to try soaking it with warm wash cloths in hopes of removing the top layer of paper; then we'll resort to Goo Gone. It's aggravating that we have to deal with this, let alone by using an adhesive remover. Goo Gone works the best, but it smells gross, lingers for sometimes months after the fact, and tends to cause sinus headaches. I hate having to use it, especially inside, but short of leaving the shredded mess on our pretty, new chest freezer, which we won't do, we have no choice. We don't understand why one sticker was easy to remove but the other has been beastly. Perhaps they came from different printers.  Con: Another eye sore, and more permanent than an ugly sticker, is that the thick power cord comes out the side instead of the back. Unless you plan on butting your chest freezer into a corner, which we aren't, then it's less than attractive. If Igloo cares so little for aesthetics,why even make one in black?  Con: As warned by seemingly 9 out of every 10 reviews, it came with a few dings, but they're towards the bottom, small, and don't include scratched paint, so it's not that obvious and, like the width, is tolerable.  Con: Without anything in it, this chest freezer is reported to weigh 100 lb. Add food to the fact that it has no wheels and you've got a heavy problem when it comes to cleaning the back and, more importantly, the strip of exposed floor behind it. Worse than not having wheels, the outlet side doesn't even have feet and is instead a strip of metal, serving both as structural support to house the compressor unit and, dimwittedly, a single &#34;foot&#34; on that side. We aren't even sure it's metal and think, from the look and feel of it, that it's plate aluminum. It's thick but still soft enough to leave marks on your tile over time, that is if you're trying to move it back and forth to clean, which repairmen recommend when it comes to keeping appliances efficient. The lack of feet on all four corners may not matter to some people, like if you're sticking it against a wall and won't ever see behind it, but like other reviewers, we bought this in black to match our kitchen appliances, so it's backed against the end of our counter. There's a 3&#34; x 29&#34; strip of exposed tile in the back (not 19&#34; like it says, remember), where dust visibly collects, plus appliances attract dust up their backsides. Ultimately, casters (i.e. ball feet) would've been best, but at the very least four dependable feet would've been nice and would've made it to where you could move the unit without risk to flooring.  Con: The silver coating that lines the inside has a few surface abrasions, but they aren't glaring and don't seem to affect the freezer's efficacy.  Con: As reported by others, it does run quietly; however, the compressor does have a slight vibrating whistle to it. Hopefully, this does not intensify over time. Let's just say we're glad we bought the extended warranty.  Con: The controls are on the bottom corner of the appliance's face. It's a bit awkward to squat and lean way over or else get on your hands and knees. This isn't that big of a deal, since, typically, refrigerator/freezer controls are rarely adjusted, but having had back problems in the past, this floor-level placement of the dial is a picky little thing I noticed.  Con: It sits unevenly, so that required a piece of cardboard. Not something you want to have to do after spending a couple hundred bucks, but it's a tolerable, easy fix.  Con: The basket is nice, but it would have been nice if the unit had come with two or even three, so as to make use of all cubic feet without simply stacking everything 4' deep.  How can we still give it 3 stars after so many cons? Well, first off, that's a testament to how badly and how long we've needed extra freezer space, that we're able to look past so many flaws to finally have one AND for it to be in black, a color that, for some inexplicable reason, is very difficult to find in a chest freezer.  Pro: It got to temperature very quickly and has done a good job thus far.   Pro: Other reviews we've read say that although the manufacturer recommends defrosting twice a year, longtime owners have a need to do it only annually. At less than a week old, the walls of ours already had a very, very light dusting of frost, but we are hopeful that once a year will be right. Even at twice a year, provided we defrost right before a grocery run when we're lowest on food, it doesn't look like it'll be difficult, albeit a bit of an inconvenience compared to self-defrosting refrigerator/freezers (as far as we know, chest freezers don't self-defrost). We'll be able to transfer chest freezer items to the main freezer and then, to release all the defrosted water, use the (supposedly easy) water outlets at the bottom of the chest (by opening both the plug inside the chest as well as the one outside the wall closest to the inside evacuation opening).  Pro: It desperately needed to be wiped down inside and out, which lifted a strange layer of something that turned damp paper towels dark gray, as though we had scrubbed our stainless-steel sink with scouring powder, but other than a few aforementioned, minor scratches on the inner liner, it seems lined well.  Pro: The lid's seal and weather stripping seem intact and without leaks, so the lid closes quietly, smoothly and solidly.  Pro: The lid isn't too heavy and, best of all, seems to stay open on its own, even when you don't have it slung all the way open. This feature allows you to lean down into it for food without worrying the lid is going to fall down on your shoulders. It's nice to not have to hold it open or worry about its integrity.  Pro: There's a neat little shelf area to one side, so it's not just a big pit at the bottom.  Pro: The basket is handy and helps utilize more cubic feet. Thanks to Amazon, we were able to find a compatible basket: Haier RF-0300-29 Refrigerator Basket. Now we have three baskets to fully using all top-to-bottom space."

B00KB874AA,"Samsung WA45H7000AW Energy Star 4.5 Cu. Ft. Top-Load Washer with SelfClean, White",Major Appliances,1,"We have had a terrible experience with this washer and the level of support from SAMSUNG.  We purchased our machine from HH Gregg on 1/22/2015.  Our washer started leaving shreds of white plastic in our clothes and listing error codes in the spin cycle the week of 7/20/15.  We contacted SAMSUNG on 7/24/2015 and told them of the problem.  SAMSUNG referred us to Precision Television (925) 825-5296.  The experience has gotten much worse as Precision Television has had issues with scheduling our appointment and then either not calling or just not showing up at the agreed upon time.  After several misses, on 8/4/2015 Precision Television finally had a technician come to our house. He diagnosed the issue as being an unbalanced washing machine and believed the white shavings to be from something in our pockets, which we did not agree with.  He left after making no repairs or running a load with actual clothes in it to see if it was broke.  When we ran the load after he left, the washer still was still not working.  To his credit, the technician returned later that night and tried to fix it and was unable to do so.  He then committed to coming back Saturday, 8/8/2015 with the parts he needed since we had not had a functioning washing machine in weeks.  Precision Television called 8/6/2015 to tell us the part would be in Friday.  On Friday 8/7/2015, Precision Television called back and told us the technician would not be there Saturday as he had promised and would not be available until 8/12/2015.  I then called SAMSUNG and told them to find another service company.  At the time of this review, we still have not had our washer repaired and the earliest the new service company can be here is 8/14/2015.  That will make 23 days that we have gone without a functioning washing machine."

B009VU6WXY,Samsung RF263BEAESR 25.6 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,I have owned this fridge for two years now and continual wrestle with the ice maker.  Ice makers have existed for over 30 years but Samsung appears to have figured they should do their own bad design.  It does not make enough ice for a family of 4 at dinner time.  It freezes up regulary and if you turn it off to go on vacation turning it on from the panel does not work.  You have to reset it.  The refrigerator function works fine but I probably will not buy another Samsung because there are considerably cheaper refrigerators out there that refrigerate as well and have ice makers that have endured years of service.  Update: Icemaker finally quit making ice.  At least this ends the need for running a blow dryer every 3 weeks to stop the ice dams.  This is my first and last Samsung appliance ever.   Before you buy a Samsung fridge go look at reviews on the amount of noise they make and ice maker issues as they both appear to be common concerns with this product.

The college had a rule that if they both had microwaves then the combined wattage must be below 1500 watts.  This is a very capable 700 watt microwave.

B00AEYWWBW,"AKDY 30"" Island Mount Stainless Steel Range Hood Kitchen Stove Vent AZ-D01(IS)-30",Major Appliances,1,"So far we've had a pretty bad experience with the range hood. It looks great, but ever since we had it installed, we've had trouble with the lights. For the first year, we had to be extremely vigilant about the lights, since if we left them on for more than an hour or so, they would start to flicker, and when you try to turn them off the control panel was unresponsive, so we would have to turn off the breaker to the entire kitchen to reset the computer so it could turn off and stop flickering and making this annoying clicking sound. It's gotten worse and worse and now, only about 13 months after having it installed, the control panel started going berserk when we tried to turn the lights on or turn the fan on, and now the fan doesn't turn on at all, and the lights turn off immediately after turning them on (when they turn on at all). The company has been responsive and has now sent us a new control panel and circuit board, but we are now looking at likely a couple hundred dollars to pay someone to install them unless my husband is able to figure out how to do it. The instructions look fairly simple for the replacements of the actual parts, but according to the instructions, the whole unit must be taken down, which is what will probably require a repair man. I'm really hoping that once we can actually get the board and panel replaces, it will fix the problem. We'll see and I'll certainly update this review!"

Consequently, I use the 30 sec. button over and over<br />until the item is cooked. That is a nuisance."

B00D7JUXMQ,Whynter Freestanding Ice Maker,Major Appliances,4,"Pros:  makes ice quickly.<br /><br />Cons:  is not as portable as described.  Needs to plumbed to a water supply, and drain needs to be available lower than bottom of the machine.  Ice starts melting as soon as it is made since bin is not refrigerated. It drains a lot of water.<br /><br />I bought to have available when we have parties.  I placed in laundry room and bought a $6 fitting to plumb to the existing laundry tub water supply.  I elevated the ice maker and drain into an existing floor drain.<br /><br />Overall for the reason I purchased unit I am satisfied."

B002MPLYEW,"Danby 120 Can Beverage Center, Stainless Steel DBC120BLS",Major Appliances,5,"Bought this fridge for my bar.  As it sits on carpet, I had to elevate the front by putting extra floor tiles underneath, so that the door opens and closes easily.  To prepare for its use, I let it sit upright for 24 hours to let everything settle. Then I plugged it in and let it run for 24 hours before putting anything in it. Finally, I began to fill it, but did so slowly to let cold air circulate and chill my beverages. After 3 days of my own prep schedule,  the fridge exceeds my expectations.  Cans and plastic bottles of water are cold and refreshing.  This is an excellent product. It looks really nice, with stainless and glass accents."

B00O2BI0W8,"Golden Vantage 30"" Under Cabinet Stainless Steel Range Hood Vent with Remote Control",Major Appliances,4,"Bought one about 1.8 years ago.  Suddenly it become default auto-detection mode by itself and shut down the fan.  Try to cancel it won't help.  I did this many many times and it just like to stay auto detection mode and no fan. Sometime it cycle through the buttons and stays on the auto mode.  I unplugged and re-plugged the power hopefully it will fix the problem.  When I re-plugged in the power, fans stay at level 1, halogen light stays on, touch button illuminated but NONE of them responsive.  Spend $389 dollars and only last 1.8 years. You judge it good or bad.  ............OK, contacted their support through chat.  They really stand behind their products.  They first sent the electronic control board, did not work; then they sent the display control panel itself.  Second time did the trick.  I left out the sensor and hopefully it will last because the smoke sensor became very greasy when I remove it."

B00U7XIS86,Samsung RF23J9011SR 22.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,5,"This fridge really struck me in the store and I am very impressed by the build quality and the innovative freezer storage compartments.  The layout of the 4 door is absolutely amazing and wonderful to work with.  All my food is perfectly eye level...  which might be dangerous for me in the long run!<br /><br />My first issue when filling this unit was that I kept running into areas where my things did not fit.  It is amazing how many items were about 1 inch too tall to fit in a bin, or on a shelf.  The flexible shelving is awesome, but 100% necessary to fit a normal jug of OJ, a wine bottle, a 2 liter, etc.  I had a lot of condiments that also did not fit into the door bins due to height.  Maybe I will need to buy smaller condiment containers (not family size) to remedy this issue.  Still trying to figure out exactly where to put everything to maximize storage options...<br /><br />Here is my biggest suggestion on this refrigerator - If you can fit the bigger 30 cu ft version in your space - Do it.  While this feels like there is a lot of storage, I am limited with too many items that are too tall - and having more cubic footage would be awesome.  The larger model will have more than enough storage space and the price is the same.  I opted for looks over volume...  (Counter depth) make your own decision here.<br /><br />Also, the flexible unit in the lower right is FANTASTIC.  I set it up at &#34;chill&#34; which sets the unit to 30 degrees F (-1C) which is just below freezing.  I find this perfect for beer, soda, and other beverages.  You actually get that crisp cold cola thing!  Only water will freeze at this temp, so alcohol or sugar laden beverages will be just fine.  The regular fridge is recommended to be set at 37 degrees F.  I enjoy keeping food up in the fridge, and beverages in the lower right section.  Looks awesome, and makes it super easy for anyone to find the right beverage.<br /><br />My unit was delivered through a *BIgBox Store* because I was concerned about having a dud and needing to have it swapped out.  My local hub had over 100 of this model in stock.  Delivery was a breeze.  It literally took them less than 10 minutes to unbox and carry the unit into the house.  I paid for &#34;hook up&#34; but apparently they only hand you a 1/4&#34; PEX line to hook up yourself.  bummer.  My RO system requires 3/8&#34; line, so I had some work ahead of me anyway. No issues at all.  It fired up, lit up, and chilled down in less than 2 hours.  This process could not have been easier in my opinion.<br /><br />last note - It has an anti fingerprint coating that isn't so anti fingerprint.  Oh well.<br /><br />On the whole, I am truly enjoying this upgrade in the kitchen and look forward to years of use.  At least I will be once I figure out how to organize everything in the right places..."

I got it to keep my breast milk cold at work until I go home. Within a few minutes, it already starts separating (for those of you who don't know when breast milk is refrigerated the fat starts to separate from the water because, unlike cow's milk you buy in the store, it is not homogenized). Buy this mimi fridge if you need one. It's cheap and highly effective."

We've owned it over a month now.  Replaced our 'old' (4 years old) high efficiency set because my wife saw this new basin equipped model.  I went along with her and I'm sooooo happy.  This aquajet technology is awesome.  Our clothes are VERY clean and VERY VERY Soft now.  I didn't realized before how they were not soft, this was enlightening.  No bulky agitator in this, it uses the aquajets to do everything.  It has some serious CURB APPEAL.  The diamond interior looks great and is downright cavernous.  We've now washed some pretty formidable (size wise) rugs with no problems.  Enough cycles to do anything....from the most delicate, to most rugged.  The wash basin is revolutionary.  We have small kids and this is perfect for their 'valuables'....teddy bears, plush books...etc!  Also good for any prewashing you may have to do....just very convenient to be right there.  I love it so much I made a video.  Check it out below.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbzZeEGeKEk"

B0084IX6RO,"RF260BEAESR 36"" Energy Star Freestanding French Door Refrigerator with 25.5 cu. ft. Capacity, (Stainless Steel)",Major Appliances,4,"We bought this on sale at Lowe's last month. The first one to be delivered had to be picked up and replaced with a new one because the first was damaged in delivery. The men delivering the fridge were friendly, but they could use some training in proper delivery of items.<br />The fridge itself is great so far except for one issue: it makes popping/cracking noises once in a while. Not often, and usually at night (so I'm guessing this has something to do with the defrost?). It is right outside our bedroom in the kitchen and we can barely hear it, so I doubt it would bother anyone if theirs is placed even further away or on another floor of the house entirely. The only time it ever was a problem was when I was completely exhausted, ready for bed, and I had forgot to close the bedroom door. Just as soon as I was falling into my well-deserved peaceful sleep, the fridge popped louder than it ever has and woke me up. That being said, do NOT buy this fridge if you live in a studio apartment lol!<br />It looks great, does a great job at properly cooling and freezing. Love the filtered water icemaker! All the space inside and the LED lighting make this a perfect fridge for us, despite the once-in-a-while pop sounds.<br />I hope that it lasts as long as the Kitchenaide fridge that came with the house. The Kitchenaide was the only fridge this house ever had in it (20 years old house), and finally just died completely one day. Kitchenaide had very reliable, well-working appliances in its day, and I suggested to the spouse that we just have a repairman look at it and possibly fix it, but he insisted we should just get a more updated fridge that looks more modern.<br />Hopefully this one is good, if not better. I'm kind of skeptical over a brand that's not been around very long and doesn't solely create household appliances, but we shall see."

B00SKJY6LM,Samsung RF26J7500SR 25.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,5,"We wanted a fridge to fit a 34&#34;-wide opening but one with 'everything', from French Doors to Bottom Freezer to a Water/Ice-maker dispenser, and it had to be Stainless Steel too. Alas, most such fridges are 35-36&#34; wide.<br />Luckily this Samsung at 32&#34; provides 25+ cubic feet of volume (5 more than our previous 32&#34; fridge) and had everything we wanted.<br />Initially we were not sure about purchasing such a large appliance online but VERY substantial savings + Amazon's reputation and the excellent reviews of 'Home Care Company', made us decide to take the plunge.<br /><br />'Home Care Company' responded promptly to emails and were very courteous and informative. Delivery was on schedule and the shipping company team was very professional. They called a day ahead, and were on time. We purchased a $50 'haul away' fee at the time we purchased the new Fridge on Amazon and the shipping company took the old fridge too.<br /><br />The fridge itself is perfect! - Fit and finish, and materials used are top notch. The Ice-Maker compartment in the fridge is fairly narrow and does not take too much space.<br />The Bottom Freezer design is perfect with one sliding drawer on top and a very deep compartment below that easily takes almost all food boxes standing sideways which lets you see instantly what's in there. No need to stack boxes on top of each other anymore..<br />Hooking up the fridge to the water supply was easy with a standard 1/4&#34; waterline (bought separately).<br /><br />On the first day the fridge made excess sound while it was working in 'faster-cooling' mode to get to the expected low temps, but turned whisper quiet after that initial 'break-in' period.<br />The front display is laid out beautifully, with nice Blue icons and digits for the various functions. A digital watch would have made it even nicer though.<br />The wide LED Lighting panels inside the fridge make it easy to see everything all the way to the back.<br />We were happy to also see that the front of the fridge is magnetized (some previous/other Samsung models were not..)<br /><br />Note: If you are not immediately hooking up the fridge to a waterline, make sure to turn off the Ice Maker (press the button for 3 sec).<br /><br />All in all we are very happy with this fridge. We had it for 6 weeks at this point.<br />(the photo was taken a short time after it was plugged in which is why the shown Temps are high.

The hot water tank tends to boil when cycling, and that can be a bit noisy, but I have not seen any coolers that do not do this recently.  I do not use the compartment for wine, but for bottled water.  Climate in the compartment is not closely controlled FYI.  There is an interlock on the door that alerts you by light if the door is not closed - a nice touch.  So my only gripe is the hot water tank noise, and it is hard to avoid that if you want to have instant hot water.  This is a very good product.  I will let you know with a later post if the compressor does not last.  Compressor life on some other coolers has become an issue recently.  Never was a problem with the American made Elkay and Cordley-Temprite coolers made up in Lanark Illinois, but with foreign made coolers, probably using compressors made with slightly looser specs, it has been more unpredictable.  I like the 'water-safe' probe feature too.  It prevents spillage when loading a bottle, and it also helps keep the system sanitary.  That was originally an Elkay (Ron Katz) concept, and no one has ever duplicated their plastic spout, which allowed water to flow quickly and evenly. Water flow is slightly slowed for large filling because of the puncture spout interior diameter and the lack of the flow characteristics engineered into the Elkay products, but it works ok."
B00ITPALES,Whynter BWR-171DS Elite 17-Bottle Seamless Stainless Steel Door Dual Zone Built-in Wine Refrigerator,Major Appliances,3,"The cooler came in nicely packaged but upon removing the box I noticed that the back top corner of the cooler has been damaged. It looks like a heavy object fell down on it so the steel is bent. Kind of really makes you wonder, because obviously the carrier didn't damage it and the producer must've packed a damaged cooler in the box and felt ok to send a damaged product to a client.<br /><br />I was a little worried that the cooler wasn't going to work because of damage and I would waste another week or two on waiting to have my order filled (which means extending my wait for having a finished kitchen since my countertops can't be put in till the cooler is in place). Surprising the cooler still works. It is actually really quite, since I was worried about noise because a lot of reviews for wine coolers seem to point out how loud they are.<br /><br />Also another thing to note is on the back of the cooler there is a wonderful sticker that says:<br />Warning: This product may contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm.<br />So that's always comforting to read..."

We threw out our groceries and called the repairman.  After a prolonged, two week period of ordering parts and trouble shooting,  we were informed that our unit is &#34;NOT repairable&#34;  We are now waiting for Samsung customer service to review our files and determine if they will do anything to compensate us for our $3,000 + investment and trust we placed in their product just a mere 15 months earlier.  This fridge design was awesome- but I will never purchase another Samsung appliance again. I don't consider a major appliance something that should be replaced annually.  After seeing other customers' similar experiences, I think Samsung should discontinue this model ASAP."
B00303XBDM,Maytag MVWB300WQ 28 4.7 cu. Ft. Top-Loader Washer - White,Major Appliances,1,We have had this machine for 4 years. It has had the technician out to work on it every year. Just scheduling this again. I am sure we are about to have our second set of bearings fail. Best thing I did was purchase Home Depot's extended warranty. Worst thing I did was buy this washer. The washer smells bad all the time because it doesn't pump out all of the water in the bottom. Have to clean it every week to keep it smelling usable and make sure you never close the lid when it is not in use. We live in the desert so that helps dry it out. If we lived somewhere wet I don't know how you would manage with it.

B001LTJSU2,Mini Kegerator Refrigerator & Draft Beer Dispenser - EdgeStar,Major Appliances,3,Much better than the Beertender as it can take both the Heinekin kegs and regular mini kegs (with the accessory kit). Downsides: 1. If the keg isn't already cold don't plan on this chilling it in under 12 hours. Its better to put the keg in the freezer for 2 hours then transfer it. 2. For the accessory kit you must buy 16gm Co2 cartridges. The device goes through one cartridge per keg. So final cost per keg = $1.25 Co2+$19.00 Keg=$20.25 for 16 10oz beers. 3. Interior light is blue (can turn on & off). Should have been white LED as with blue it is hard to display the keg and just plain looks stupid.

Not that delivery has anything to do with the product.  But, some people don't understand what they are reviewing.  I only buy items after careful consideration and comparison of other brands.  These, for the price, couldn't be beat.  I'll add more to my review as we use them more, right now we have only had them for a few weeks.  The lady of the house loves to laundry now, and now.... I still hate it.  If the light bulb burns out, I am not going to run around Amazon bad mouthing and giving poor reviews on items I don't own or know anything about.  I'd just replace the .50 cent bulb and carry on with my life.  Update 1/16: Have had these for 5 months.  No issues.  Have used almost every cycle including the sanitize.  The tub clean cycle is nice when it's time to clean the machine.  The machine has no problems doing a full load of wet towels (had a water line break in the kitchen), I advised my lay-dee!!!, not to throw all (6) towels in, but she did anyway.  The unit will compensate for heavy loads and adjust accordingly to keep it from vibrating/hopping."

B00IBHK400,Deflect-o Dryer duct Cleaning Brush Kit DVBRUSH12K/6,Major Appliances,1,"We have a screened porch attached to the house. The dryer vent is within the porch area so we've always had to deal with the hot wet air and lint. We had our house re-sided last fall and as part of the project an extension from the dryer vent was added (with a nice cover) so that it now exits the porch solving our past problems. The dryer vent extension extends straight down the exterior house wall and then makes a 90 degree turn and runs along the porch floor about 9 feet and exits the porch via a vent cover with a cover flap to keep the critters and bugs out when not in use.<br /><br />I needed a dryer duct brush to clean this new arrangement. It had to be flexible so I could clean the entire duct work from both ends. This product seemed like the perfect solution. I was very disappointed with the results.<br /><br />I actually read the directions and heeded the warning if the brush was going to be used with a drill  to ensure that none of the sections that screw on to each other came apart due to use of a drill. The first, and only time I used it the last two sections of the brush with the brush head came off and was now somewhere in the dryer ductwork.<br /><br />Now I was stuck with a duct brush in my dryer vent and had to figure out how to get it out. Using a long broom handle and a hook I screwed into the end of the handle I was able to grab it and pull it close enough to pull out.<br /><br />I won't ever be using this dryer brush arrangement with a drill again, it will be by hand if I ever use it at all. I ended up buying another type of duct brush attached to 10 feet  of flexible twisted wire coated in plastic. I'll most likely use that in the future to clean the duct from both ends of the duct work.<br />So, if you're gonna buy this brush, beware before you think about using a drill. You might not be as lucky as I was to get the brush out."

And of coarse i got the I'm sorry sir it's out of warranty BS. Really, this is a manufacturing defect and your not going to help me? Nope. Unbelievable!!! Also, I can tell you that after tearing this thing apart it has very poor quality parts for what you pay. There is no commercial components in this unit at all unlike what I was told. I could say a lot more but what's the point. Just stay away from this company unless you like unbelievably bad service.

B002ZWR194,NewAir AW-121E 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,5,"Hello,<br />I do extensive research every single time I want to buy something. So, I hope this review helps anyone looking for an 18 bottle wine fridge. First of all, this is an 18 bottle wine fridge. It is not a wine fridge that states its 18 bottles and fits 14. With a little rack manipulation you can easily fit 18 bottles. I have champagne in there, pinot noir in there and cabernets. I've seen reviews saying that fancier thick glassed bottles don't fit into some fridges. I belong to a very expensive wine club located in Napa Valley. I am sure for the cost I am paying for those bottles their glass is quite good. Like I said, no issues making it fit. Just make sure you do some mixing and matching. As for function, this baby is very quiet. I have no put a thermometer in the fridge because I set the temp, and gave it a lot of clearance on each side. Side note: the manual says its ok for built in requiring 3&#34; of space. Online it says it is not made for built in and it needs 5 &#34; of space. I went with a free standing, 5&#34; clearance to be safe and every time I pull a bottle out it is nicely chilled. The racks are constructed well, and the stainless steel looks great. I love this fridge. Make sure you keep the fridge upright in the place you intend it to be for a day or so before you turn it on. I also recommend reading and following any instructions in the manual. Finally, if you are still skeptical...do what I did. Buy the protection plan for 12.60. Its worth it for something that I keep 100's of dollars worth of wine in. I hope this finds you well and good luck on your search.<br /><br />Andrew"

B00AW04ZMM,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine 7.9-15lbs with Spin Cycle …,Major Appliances,4,"Background:  Single guy living in 1960's condo with no washer/dryer hookups.  Laundry in the basement (3 toploaders, 3 dryers, 36 unit building).<br />I got tired of having to tapdance around other people and have had some clothes ruined with bleach stains from communal washers. Got tired of going up and down the elevator and setting timers for wash and dry cycles.  Got tired of large folding chore from letting laundry pile up.<br /><br />So I gave this a shot.  This definitely cleans clothes well, and quickly.  My 'light' loads wash for 4-5 minutes and my heavier jeans and towels, I wash for about 5-7 minutes; I rinse for about 3 minutes; then spin for 2-3 minutes.  At an average of 10-15 minutes per load, it is easy to get through a week's worth of laundry while doing other activities.  TIP:  I fill this with a bucket rather than the included hose.  The hose works well. but it does not fit on my sink faucet.  You can save LOTS of time by filling your bucket during each cycle.  So  fill your bucket, wash, and while washing, fill your bucket for rinse; while rinsing, fill your bucket for next load.  This REALLY speeds things up.<br /><br />I am not a country boy or a smelly single guy -- I am not a metro, but my Mom, so many years ago, was a clean freak.  Clothing isn't clean to me if it smells at all.  AT ALL.  It isn't clean unless the rinse water has the merest tinge of blue fabric softener, no brown or gray from dirt.  So, I am not one to reuse wash water, and I do not.  That said, a 5 minute wash REALLY gets clothes clean.  To each their own, but I am particular about clean clothes, and this machine does the job.<br /><br />Like most men, I overload washers constantly. You cannot overload this guy or the clothes will not spin to clean. Be patient, and remember that you are not sitting at a laundromat or a dank basement.  :)<br /><br />For a load, I use less than a tablespoon of Tide powder, less than a table spoon of fabric softener, and then add a bit more fabric softener in the Rinse, just a touch.  There are a few bubbles in the wash drain cycle and Rinse water is clean.  This is the correct amount to use. If your water is foamy like crazy, you're using too much product.  For lightly soiled items, you can load and wash.  For dirtier or thicker stuff, I let it soak in the soapy water for 5 or 10 minutes.  For whites that aren't so white, I have used OxyClean in a bucket, allowed my whites to soak for an hour, then wash them and they came out 'okay'.<br /><br />If you use bleach with this machine, make sure to RINSE TWICE.  This should get rid of enough of the bleach to keep subsequent loads safe from bleach stains.<br /><br />Clothes come out of the spin cycle more dry than they do out of a commercial washer, and I hang dry everything.<br /><br />I have done 6 loads and am still working out my &#34;system&#34; but filling buckets during wash and rinse cycles is really where its at.  It really speeds up the entire process, and I LOVE being able to work or watch TV or clean the kitchen or whatever while the wash is getting done.  The smaller loads encourage me to do a load or three whenever I have time, and the clothes are clean and fresh.  I own two drying racks in case I ever get behind, but so far, I've only needed one.<br /><br />My only concern is that even after the machine has run a full Drain cycle, there is still water in the bottom of the machine -- not the bottom of the tub -- the bottom of the machine.  I have yet to devise a solution for this.  So far, I have just picked the machine up , turned it upside down, etc.  This is not going to be a solution for many people who use this machine.  The concern here is that the rinse water, which should be pretty clean, is just hanging out in the dark recesses of the machine.  Storing the machine with the doors open is a good idea to avoid mildew.<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed that there is still water sloshing around in the machine?  How do you handle it?<br /><br/>All in all, for around $200 with shipping, the machine is good looking, well built, light, and allows condo and apartment dwellers and older folks who cannot go up and down stairs so well, as well as summer home/cabin by the lake dwellers, etc., to have a great wash option that is quick, easy, works great and is convenient.  It was worth the money to me.<br /><br />EDIT:  I am 6&#34; and a big guy and I can fit a fair of jeans and several shirts in one load. I can fit 2 regular towels and lots of kitchen and hand towels in one load.  I can fit maybe 5 pairs of boxers and 5 pairs of socks and a T shirt or two in one load. If you have oversized towels, or beach towels, you'll have to wash one at a time with one or two smaller items.<br /><br />You can wash slightly more than you can spin dry at a time -- but the spine drying LITERALLY takes between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.  For example, I washed a thermal hoodie, XL, with rubber liner (for extreme cold and wind), and several other items. When the wash and rinse was done, I put JUST the hoodie in the spinner and ran it for about 30 seconds, and it came out VERY dry.  Then, I spun the rest of the stuff for a minute or so.  The wash and rinse cycle is long, but even with a few seconds of spinning, the water is mostly out of the clothing.  Spinning longer is a waste of time and electricity.  That spinner is efficient."
B004W29A2Q,KitchenAid Architect Series II KFXS25RYMS 36 25.0 cu. ft. French Door Refrigerator,Major Appliances,3,"We've had this model for over a year. Inside it is a great fridge; plenty of space for large trays of food. Use of door space is well done. We often have large groups of people over for parties which is why we went with this model. We have not been disappointed with the space and love the middle drawer for produce and the clear glass in main compartment that lets you see into that drawer.<br /><br />The significant flaw is the thoroughly useless drain for water to flow into the evaporation pan. It clogs very easily and ice builds up on the bottom of the freezer - a huge sheet of it. After a week the water starts leaking out around the fridge. We remove the ice sheet and repeat the process over and over. I've cleaned the drain in the back but the issue persists. Other reviews say the same thing. The engineers of this potentially excellent product must have outsourced the creation of a drain to some shmo on the street.<br /><br />Ice Maker: Some reviews say the ice maker doesn't make enough ice to even fill up the glasses for meals. If you're the Waltons at Thanksgiving that would be a problem. Our summers are wretchedly hot and humid and the kids are hauling ice as fast as the thing can make it, but we have run out only on a couple of occasions. At least for a family of 5 the ice maker is just fine.<br /><br />I would recommend this refrigerator if the drain wasn't an issue."

B001YQGDS2,Koolatron Coca Cola 10-Can Retro Vending Fridge,Major Appliances,3,"A++ on style; had couple of co-workers love the look. In terms of keeping it cold, it underperforms on this mark. I work in an air conditioned room although it does not feel like it's cooler than my work environment. Also when I press button to dispense, I have to shake it a bit gor it to drop. Another negative is the drop of the canned drink- the panel on bottom doesn't insulate the fall where I opened a can and it spilled out. I give it 3 since it does somewhat keep the drinks cooler and its style. Keeping drinks within arms reach at work is better thsn risking your drinking being stolen using the work fridge."

I use them to keep breast milk cool in a bottle in my diaper bag, and one (or two, depends what shape bottle I use) of these fit in the insulated pocket right next to the bottle.

No water seemed to get in. Low water level error i read, so took a chance. While installing it is not too bad, I hate those hose clamps you squeeze to loosen. This part did not come with 2 wires, so I had to pull from part I was removing (hence 4 and not 5 stars). I am now running a test cycle for a good while, water is in tub! Assuming I have securely reattached 2 hoses, my hand washing days are over! If not, I will flood my lower level. THEN it will be worth the service call of $99 just for the guy to come before he even steps into the kitchen. If I did a good job, SO worth the price of the part and 60 minutes it took to replace!   ********************One year later.... Same error on washer so I just ordered again. Seemed easier to replace this time since I knew what to do. One I replaced last year...the float was sticky so would not work.

The water supply had a brand new 5 stage RO unit I stalled on the basement wall right under the sink. I ran a line from the RO to the icemaker. If you look behind the filter housing. Remove the right upper cover. It runs from the rear corner to the back of the filer plug in unit.<br />I removed that molding and there's 2 water lines behind it. The are 5/16 hose, so I ran to home depot bought a simple 5/16 X 5/16 push on coupler. Unhooked the brown hose first. Had no water in it and connected both hoses to the new coupler. Price: 5 bucks or so and the filter is now bypassed. Started making ice daily again. I stuck the old filter in because it's empty looking if u dont!

I had to send the first order back because both the box and the hood was damaged. Second time around, the box showed up in one piece but the Range hood had a welding defect on the side of the unit. I installed it anyway as the defect is mostly cosmetic not structural (hopefully). I wouldn't buy a Broan again if I were looking for a real quality Range hood but for the money, it works ok."

I searched for awhile on several sites to find this part. I always read the reviews first. I kept coming back to this one, because it had such good reviews, where as the original part did not have nearly as good reviews. I also loved the fact that it came in a 2-pack!

But since we had it installed about a month ago, it has never run a complete cycle on Auto Wash. The &#34;Active&#34; light would blink continuously, through a whole day.  We first noticed that after a cycle the dishwasher was smelly, then noticed there was standing water in the bottom.  After the first week, we discovered that the &#34;Half Load&#34; would run through a complete cycle (with the &#34;clean&#34; light illuminated at the end of the cycle), but that stopped working about a week later.  We did call Lowes where we had purchased this, and eventually they told us that they would replace the dishwasher but Bosh was no longer manufacturing this model (not sure if that's true -- it's still advertised).  Odd that they didn't send a repair person, or even run through diagnostics (though we did what we could with the manual). We've got a Whirlpool on order -- sure hope we're happier with that one.  Like other reviewers, we also noticed that the rack configuration on this Bosch is quite odd -- not horrible for a two-person household, but certainly awkward.  And the bottom rack consistently falls off the rails.  Maybe we're lucky, after all!"

B0056AP33S,Ascenta SHE3ARL6UC 24&quot; Full Console Built-In Dishwasher with 5 Wash Cycles 12 Place Settings Long Silverware Basket and 50 dBA Silence Rating in,Major Appliances,1,"When my old dishwasher stopped working, we needed a replacement... quick! We were in the market for a mid-range dishwasher that would get the job done. I let my husband go to the appliance store alone, with a list of possible options (Whirlpool, Frigidaire... and one Bosch, since I had heard good things). This one was not on the list, but the saleslady must have done a good job convincing the DH because this is what we got.  I have hated it from the beginning.  Why do I hate it so?  Let me count the ways:<br /><br />1. The inside is VERY poorly designed!  The bottom of the top rack is not flat, so cups tip over during the cycle and fill with dirty water.  Gross.<br />2. The inside is VERY poorly designed!  The pegs on the bottom rack are spaced very strangely.  I cannot put two rows of dishes (small and large) next to each other because there isn't enough room.  They just don't fit!<br />3.  The inside is VERY poorly designed!  Some of the pegs are so close together that I don't feel the dishes get cleaned very well, so I have to space the dishes out more to get them cleaner.<br />4.  The inside is VERY poorly designed!  There is no good place to put the silverware holder.  If I put it along the side, I lose a row of pegs for dishes.  If I put it along the back, I lose a row of pegs for dishes.<br />5.  I can only fit one pot/pan on the bottom if I am washing dishes, too.  No matter how I try to rearrange the dishes, there just doesn't seem to be enough room to make things fit.<br />6.  I don't know if it's the poor design of the racks or if it is truly smaller on the inside, but this dishwasher washes much smaller loads than my last two dishwashers. I need to run it twice as many times as my old ones in order to do the same amount of dishes.<br />7. Because I am constantly washing smaller loads of dishes, this machine is costing me more $$$ in water and detergent!<br />8.  Since I can't get all the dishes from one meal to fit in a load, my sink is constantly filledwith more dirty dishes waiting for their turn to be washed.  Ugh.<br />9. I hate the buttons and the flashing lights!  If you don't actually press the on/off button before opening the dishwasher after running a load, the lights will blink... and blink... and blink... until you do.<br />10.  This dishwasher is the worst one I have ever owned!  I secretly hope it will break so I can toss it into the dumpster where it belongs and get myself a decent dishwasher!!!<br /><br />I cannot think of one positive thing to say about this dishwasher.  It really is terrible.  We are a family of four, not using a ton of dishes, and this thing is awful.  I would not recommend it to anyone!"
B004N4MSPO,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"I think we've used this dishwasher for 3 years now. We didn't have room for a normal dishwasher. We would have had to rebuild the cabinets to fit one in, so going with an on-the-counter option like this one was a very attractive idea.<br /><br />The hoses hook up easily. You connect the supply hose to your faucet, and you run the drain hose into your sink. They're attached in one unit, so it's easy to use. You can hook this up in a permanent fashion if you stick it in a cabinet and run the hoses to attachments on the wall. Just keep in mind that water won't flow uphill, so the drain line has to go downward. Several reviews complained about water standing in the unit, and I'm willing to bet that gravity is a contributing factor.<br /><br />After several years of use, we're remodeling our kitchen and going with a full-size washer. I'd definitely recommend this unit to someone in an apartment without a dishwasher or someone who, like us, didn't have the option to install a full-size.<br /><br />I'll mention also that we bought rectangular plates from IKEA that fit perfectly. 8&#34; round plates fit well. Our bigger 10&#34; round plates were a little snug, but they fit if they're tilted just a little bit. We had no problems with glasses or silverware. It's not quite tall enough to fit a gallon pitcher."
B0050KKD9S,Whirlpool Part Number 8535568: Link.

B000SOJKA4,Whirlpool LTE5243DQ 24-Inch Thin-Twin Stacked Washer/Dryer Electric Laundry Center,Major Appliances,1,"I have never reviewed anything before, but I have to warn you, DO NOT BUY the Whirlpool Thin Twin!! Now, I have owned a Thin Twin for over 20 years and it was a great machine....WAS a great machine... But last year I got a new one and I HATE IT!! The problem is that they have a water regulator/governor that doesn't let the water level go beyond medium. I used to be able to wash 7 towels in a large load, now I can only wash 4. Problem is I still need 7 towels washed, so all they have succeeded in doing is wasting my time because it now takes me 2 loads to do my washing instead of one load! This is why I HATE this machine because it eats my free time for no damn reason, there are no water savings, only wasting of the precious little time I have at home, and instead of playing with my kids, I'm now constantly doing freaking laundry. I'm done with Whirlpool! Don't buy this machine!"

B0057YO0IM,Ascenta SHE3AR52UC 24&quot; Full Console Built-In Dishwasher with 4 Wash Cycles 14 Place Settings 24/7 Overflow Leak Protection and 50 dBA Silence Rating in,Major Appliances,5,"I posted some longer comments under Rich's longer review.  However, I have had this dishwasher for 13 months, and it has been a great washer.  It works much better than older Whirlpool that it replaced I thought  a lot of reviews were way too negative.  Only issue was some of the white haze, but I have had no problem since I cut detergent to 50% of owner's manual recommendation and used Normal or Heavy wash.  The auto wash is not good on this model.  I think some problems come from people who have hard water.  I live in North Carolina where the water is fairly soft.  For detergent, I use target up and up powder which is similar to cascade regular.  Small amount of target powder worked better than the recommended finish tabs.  Cascade complete is bad also since they went phosphate free.  Dishwasher does have a somewhat small capacity.  A fairly full load is around 12 plates 15 glasses 5 bowls."

However, I have to stand ready with my Dyson cordless, handheld vacuum when I pull the trap out to clean it. It fits in so tightly, pulling it out basically throws lint everywhere (which kind of defeats the purpose of having it).

B00CVY4UAY,Stainless Steel Fill Hose 5-foot (Set of 2) With Elbow,Major Appliances,3,"Well made hoses with a curved connector instead of the sharp angle most have but, once installed, the water pipes now knock inside the walls behind my washing machine. Never experienced this before with my HE front load washer with the OEM rubber hoses. I'm assuming that the curve is just enough to restrict /change the water pressure a bit. There are solutions to eliminate the knock but, it would require adding a water hammer arrestor. Update 8-11-15 Changed out these steal hoses with new rubber hoses and the water hammer noise is gone. My theory is that the rubber hoses allow just enough expansion in the hose to accommodate the sudden shut off of water during the washer fill up?? There is also a curved connector on the female end of the rubber hoses I bought so, I no longer believe it might have been the curved connector that was causing the hammer issue as I mentioned in my first review. I researched a lot of water hammer arrestors (those that didn't require cutting the pipes and soldering to install) but, after speaking with a plumber, he commented that his experience with the arrestors that screw on was that they eventually fail and have to be replaced) These steel hoses are really well made but, the water hammer noise was really loud in the wall behind my washer when I was using the steel hoses and I was just too afraid of any future damage caused by the hammering. I've accepted that I'll have to be changing out the rubber hoses every couple of years to ease my worries about a water fill hose bursting from old age. BTW - my home was built in 1981 so, the water pipes inside my wall may not have been secured well to begin with."

It does not, as proclaimed, make &#34;consistent cube size and shape&#34;, and as for being the &#34;quietest&#34;, well...  The noise when producing ice is, about at that of the old 1970's dishwashers level. Really loud. As for the ice falling into the bay, unlike our Scotsman, that is very quite as proclaimed.

The contractor sent out employees who didn't seem to know anything about either refrigerators or customer service.  Both Samsung and the contractor gave us the runaround repeatedly. Neither showed any interest in trying to make things right.  We will not buy Samsung products again, nor will our business, our extended family, or our friends.  Atrocious customer service."

When she did take it, it would take her a week or so to get it back to me. So, I purchased this machine so I could do my own laundry.

B002OBTC20,Electrolux : EI28BS56IS 27.8 cu. ft. French-Door Refrigerator - Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,1,"Electrolux is all Marketing and no customer service.  I bought a $3000 refrigerator and I have probably put $40 of my own ice in it to dispense because the icemaker stopped making ice.  They have been giving me the run around for months.  They send me a letter with the wrong phone number and that number has since turned into 5 other numbers with each one telling me that I need to call a different number.  Then they say that the tilt out tray in the freezer needs to be replaced even though I am 100% sure that it is never left tilted because we don't use it.  They say it can stick in tilt position and cause ice to not freeze.  They arranged service to get it replaced but then I never heard from anyone for at least a month.  I called their service provider and they said they never got the part and are still waiting _ for the part that I know I do not need!  Weeks go by.  I call Electrolux again and get passed to 2 more phone numbers to learn that the local service provier (unbeknownst to them) needed to request the part which they didn't do.  So we are all waiting for a part I don't need and a part that they did not automatically send to the service provider.  Months have gone my and I still am no closer to getting a working icemaker.  If you want the icemaker to work for a sustained amojunt of time, DO NOT buy an electrolux.  Lots of money.  Lots of Hype.  Not much else.  Friends bought an LG years ago and have never had a  problem.  BEWARE."
B002HT0958,Mini Portable Countertop Spin Dryer,Major Appliances,5,"if I have to choose between a washer and a spinner-drier, I'd take the latter.  this small spinner handles all towels (one at a time!), sheets(one, again), and of course all the littler stuff.  Hang them up indoors and they dry in hours. I wash EVERYthing using this spinner. I soak or swish-wash stuff, plop it in the spinner to spin out the soapy water, rinse it again, then<br />spin it again.  Sometimes I repeat this step. I do everything in the bathtub to avoid drips."

The only issue is that it took a week for it to air out.  You could still smell it a couple of weeks later.  But eventually it went away.  Overall, I'm happy.

We liked it so much we gave a similar unit to our friend. After 8 months the upper cooling section would no longer hold the temperature to 60 degrees and rose to over 70 degrees (who needs a cooler) spoiled six botlles of wine. Tried for three months to get the temp down to no avail. Called Distributor. They would only send another box to repack unit and send it back to them at our cost. Tried to get them to send a replacement unit. I would then transfer the twelve bottles in the bottom section to the new unit and pack the defective one in the carton from new unit for return to distributor. No way would they do that way. So now I spoil another 12 bottles of wine. The spoiled wine would then total far more in cost than cooler. Additionally my friends cooler had the same problem. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.

Each time I have to wait at least a week before they send out a technician. I just want my money back as this is total crap!!! Best Buy is where i bought it and they are not helpful either.

B00C8DHX34,GE GTWN5650FWS 3.9 Cu. Ft. White Top Load Washer,Major Appliances,4,"My daughter and I each purchased this washer after doing a lot of research. She is selling her 6 mo old Whirlpool Cabrio due to their household is on a well. She hates the Cabrio as she has to wash loads sometimes 2 or 3 times. Also, the water level is so low in the machine with no graduated water level option. The washer has just one extra choice....Deep Fill, but the agitation and spin with Deep Fill is too strong for hand washables. The Cabrio is working and I suppose for city folks it would be OK who don't have very dirty laundry. I'm aware of other people owning this machine having to add water. Currently I'm visiting my daughter so I have used the Cabrio. I'm in complete agreement with her...I hate that thing! I wasn't able to make any adjustments to suit my clothing as I'm very careful doing laundry. My clothing has a lot of embellishments and I don't purchase cheaper lingerie. I was at the ghastly machine's mercy! These HE machines brag about how much water they spin out, but just think about it, the stronger the spin the more wrinkles are set. Also, a strong spin is too hard for most clothing.<br />Her GE GTWN5650FWS has been delivered and what a difference! It has an agitator! Whoo Hoo! We also can adjust the water level, the spin speed,etc. She actually has enjoyed doing laundry again with a statement &#34;I love that washer!&#34;. Mine has not been delivered. I own a very expensive 6 yr old Whirlpool Duet frontloader set that is still working fine, but I've always disliked a machine &#34;thinking&#34; for me. The biggest gripe I have with that monster is if I make an error in choosing a cycle different from what I wanted....the stupid thing drains and spins in order to change cycles. There goes all my detergent, additives and water! What a waste! Also, that seven to ten year life cycle is fast approaching. My Sears tech says the struts are what goes and it's VERY expensive to repair. My salesman purchased his set about the same time I did. His broke downin less than 6 years. Would have cost him $1500.00 to repair! He was happy he had the extended warranty. So, I'm &#34;taking the bull by the horns&#34; so to speak, and disposing of it before the thing breaks down with a full load. The delivery guys can do with it what they wish as I still have the stabilizer bolts that came with it when delivered. These front loaders should NOT be moved without them. I've never liked the dryer either as it tangles and &#34;ropes&#34; clothes worse than any dryer I've had (7 of 'em). Moved a lot and the new owners always wanted the appliances. This will be the first time in over 30 yrs I won't have a matching set. I purchased the GE Right Height with Detangle Assist. Dryer drum has reverse action tumble...no more clothes in a huge ball, wet in the center and my husband's shirt sleeves roped so tight I had to rewash them! I plan on donating the dryer to our local animal shelter or Salvation Army as a dryer is fairly easy to move. Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it! Can't wait for the newbies! I'm going to enjoy doing laundry again. As an after thought, I am going to miss the washer's Extended Tumble option after the cycle is finished as it did help prevent wrinkles from setting. Always had it on my dryers, but it really is a nice feature on the washers, also."
B002VW7ZHQ,"Haier HUF205PB 20.5 Cubic Foot Capacity Full-Size Frost-Free Freezer, White",Major Appliances,1,"My siblings and I bought this freezer for my Mom for Christmas 2012 to replace a chest freezer that was probably 30 years old. It was delivered in January 2013 and all was well. However, the freezer went out in late April 2015. Approximately May 15th we contacted the company (Haier) and they told us to contact a local repair person and they gave us name and number. They also told me that parts are covered under warranty but labor is not - so be aware of that possible cost. We called the local repair company and made an appointment for June 5 (~three weeks) to come and check the freezer. The appointment was confirmed by the repair company the day before. On the day of the appointment, we received a call saying they had gone out of business. We again contacted the parent company (Haier) on June 8 and were given the name of a different repair company. We contacted the second repair company and an appointment was made for Jul 3 (~two weeks). The repair person came that day but could not contact the parent company to confirm if the freezer was covered. I figured the entire point of having trusted repair companies was that they would know the warranty but apparently not. They said we would be called on July 6. We received a call two weeks later stating a new compressor was ordered and they would call us when it came in. About 10 days later they called and came to install the compressor on July 28. The freezer was cooling. My Mom did notice the suction was not the same as before but attributed it to the freezer not reaching the correct temperature yet. On Aug 1 she put frozen food in the freezer. Several hours later everything had thawed. By the morning of Aug 2, the inside temperature was hot and she unplugged the freezer. So nearly 3 months after we initially contacted the company my Mom still has a broken freezer and we get to play this game again. I wouldn't recommend this freezer or this company to anyone."

B00UT8NPY6,"RCA RPW091 0.9 cu. ft. Portable Washer, White",Major Appliances,4,"I have had this machine for 24 hours and have done 4 loads of wash. My clothes look, feel, and smell very clean. The only issue I had was with the faucet adapter, but I finally figured it out. I had to remove one of the rubber seals and then screw the adapter to the faucet. The white ring moves up and down, so you can leave the adapter on the faucet if you want, and just re-attach the hose via movable white ring when you use the machine. I'm sure I'm not explaining it well, and the only reason I figured it out is because we had an attachment like that on our portable dishwasher when I was a kid. I'm adding a photo so you can see what the sink adapter looks like once you get it apart. When you open the box, this adapter is inside the white ring on the water hose, so screw it on like normal, and then pull down on the white ring, and voila! The adapter stays on. Keep in mind, the adapter doesn't have a filter, so don't run the water full blast or it gets a little splashy when you're doing dishes or refilling the Brita. The machine is pretty quiet, so it shouldn't bother apartment neighbors much. The spin is amazing, so my clothes dry well on a drying rack or hangers. The lid doesn't lock, so I am able to add fabric softener when it's time. It WILL beep at you if you are slow like I am. Overall, I am quite pleased with my purchase."

B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,5,"This was a total game changer before we had a large outdoor party on July 4th. We received it a few days before the party and started making ice right away. We placed them in ziploc bags and put in the freezer until the party. Saved quite a bit of money as we probably made 40-50 pounds of ice which would have cost quite a bit that weekend. Stores tend to increase prices on items like this since people need ice and they will buy it. True to the actual specs. shown - we kept it going during the party as well, and people would use the scoop to add ice to their drinks right from the ice maker. It is currently put away until the next event. I've already had someone ask to borrow mine for an event they are having, so this was a great purchase."

B005HF61ZQ,"GE Cafe CGP650SETSS 36"" Built-In Gas Cooktop",Major Appliances,1,"We recently purchased a GE Cafe gas cooktop in our home kitchen. We have had other GE appliances in the past, and have found them to be reliable, quality products. But we cannot say the same for this cooktop. By the second time we used it to cook dinner, two of the knobs had broken. These knobs control the gas to the burners. They are stainless steel handles with a thin plastic stem that engages the control valve. The stems split, allowing the knobs to turn without turning the valve stem. On one occasion this made it difficult to tell if the gas had been shut off, while on another we were unable to shut off the flame. <br /><br />Because the knobs break easily and can turn without operating the gas control valve, the gas could potentially be left on. We are also worried that there could be more instances of the flame being unable to be shut off at the cooktop. Both of these situations could lead to serious injury. A search of the internet leads us to believe that this problem has happened many times previously, and that GE has been made aware of the problem some time ago. Why has it not been fixed? We expected better from the GE reputation and from our past experiences, and are sorely disappointed. We plan to contact GE Customer Service to see if there is any remedy. We have also reported the problem to the Consumer Product Safety Commission."

B0017GVSK2,Equator EZ3720CEE 14-Pound Combo Ventless Condensing Washer Dryer,Major Appliances,5,"A mixed bag. In 1998 I purchased an Equator with the built in dryer. Until I moved in 2010 it was still going strong and I found out through friends it was still going in 2012. A great unit, quality throughout.<br />I knew a woman who purchased one (on my advice) in 2009. Not good, many problems and come to find out, it was no longer made in Italy but put together with parts from China, Mexico and Hungry. Had a good thing going on but it seems that greed gets the better of most. Always trying to squeeze out another penny no matter what. My original Equator was like a Roles Royce of washing machines"
B007V7G5TU,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,3,"Arrived with a visible dent on the door. Will update this review when I receive a replacement and can properly evaluate it.  Update: Serviceable microwave at a reasonable price. Lack of a &#34;+30 second&#34; or &#34;+1 minute&#34; feature is annoying. Inability to turn off alarms/beeping is also annoying. Poor design. But it does shoot microwaves through food, so there's that."
B002HT0958,Mini Portable Countertop Spin Dryer,Major Appliances,4,"It works, I like it. It's probably not the greatest things out there for this purpose, but it does its job and does it well. It does make wringing wet items out much easier and now when I need to wash/rinse something by hand it no longer drips & take forever to dry. I simply do not have the strength to hand wring. I never did. You do have to watch when you load it up, be careful not to over fill it and you must watch over it while it is spinning. I've already had one of my curious cats learn the hard way that this is not a kitty toy. Thankfully she hit the button on top that pops the lids and stops the centrifuge, some water spritzed out on her and she didn't care for that. So now she leaves it alone. It is also rather tiny. When I said be careful I mean it. I can put maybe 2 tee shirts and a couple pairs of under wear or just 1 pair of jeans. Washcloths are fine but towels are 1 at a time. Make sure that it is loaded evenly (there are a handful of YouTube videos that can give you ideas on how to do this), if it's not even it makes a dreadful noise and falls over.  This is all a lot of work for wringing out some clothes, still it's worth it and I'm glad to have it. It makes the &#34;in-between&#34; washings so much easier."

Today I was emptying the &#34;clean&#34; dishes and the glasses were all smudged, the cups still had coffee stains on the inside and a drip of coffee on the outside that didn't even wash off.  I would not recommend this dishwasher to my worst enemy.  I had always had Whirlpool dishwashers and for whatever reason bought this piece of junk.  Do not buy this dishwasher - wish I had seen these reviews before buying mine."
B00MEOD2C8,"Haier 5.0-cu ft Freezer, White",Major Appliances,5,"My husband and I purchased this 5.0 cu. ft. Haier Freezer about three years ago.  It is just the two of us so we do not need a lot of extra room.  This freezer is perfect for us.  Right now in it we have over 30 frozen dinners, 8 pints of ice cream, assorted boxes of frozen food and the basket is full of a lot of stuff that probably needs to be thrown out quite frankly.  You can tell from the photo that I really need to defrost it.  Even with all that food (and there is more tucked under the basket) there is still plenty of room to cram in more if the need strikes.  I love this little freezer.  It says 5.0 cu. ft. but that doesn't really mean anything to me so the inside dimensions are 23&#34;L x 15&#34;W x &#34;28&#34;H.  There is a ledge inside the freezer under the basket which will take up part of the room on that side.  If you find my review helpful please let me know and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below and I will answer them as quickly as possible.   Thank you for checking out my review."

B00DNSO1OW,Haier  Wine Cellar with Electronic Controls,Major Appliances,3,"Decent fridge.  Does the trick for the most part for reds. Not sure I'd get it to keep whites super chilled. Luckily I'm a red drinker. The fridge doesn't seem to get really cold and I keep it at 47....for reds (I know it's not supposed to be that cold for reds but the wine doesn't come out that cold on this temp). Wish they made it a hair deeper to hold prosecco/champagne bottles.  Unfortunately if there is a power surge from a storm (or any time the electric shuts off) the fridge temp resets each time and if you don't notice it, then your fridge is back up in the 60's. Took me a few times to realize what was happening...now I have a power surge cord connected to it."

Its seems like this its on a timer and kicks on about every 30 seconds.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong if you have the TV on you won't ever hear it but in silence you will defiantly notice it.<br /><br />If you purchase this I would suggest not putting the fridge in a populated place"

B009AK62U8,"Broan QML30SS Under-Cabinet Range Hood, 30-Inch 200 CFM, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,"There are several things we love about this hood compared to most we looked at.  The dual spotlights do a great job illuminating the cooktop, and the closed bottom makes for a cleaner looking installation and will definitely be easier to clean in the future.  On the low setting the fan is so quiet my wife sometimes forgets she's turned it on, and on the high setting while it's not exactly silent it's considerably quieter than the older unit we replaced while also moving a fair amount of air.<br />Installation was pretty much what I expected, our only difficulty being that our kitchen cabinets don't quite have the shape the hood designers expected--and when we took the old hood down we could see that the original installers had faced the same problem with our old hood so it's not the hood that's odd but our kitchen.  We ended up adding a couple pieces of wood to fill the gaps that shouldn't have been there and then screwed the hood into place as it was designed."

B00O1BU6OO,"SAMSUNG NE58H9970WS Slide-In Induction Range, 30-Inch, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,"My only complaint about this is the touch display...Often while cooking I bump it and it turns on the display and even if you hit &#34;oven off&#34; you have to wait a minute or so for the display to turn off. I have also accidentally turned on the warming drawer twice. I am trying to get in the habbit of using the child lock so that this doesn't happen. This locks the display and the oven door. You need to then &#34;unlock&#34; &#34;relock&#34; and then &#34;re-unlock&#34; (holding the button 3 seconds each time) to get the door to open.<br /><br />Cooks amazing! I love that the temperature can be controlled very easily with the induction cook top. I haven't tried using the dual temp in the oven, but sometimes have just used one area, which makes preheating faster. I have baked a few cakes in this oven, and find that the convection element makes the cook times on the faster side."

It comes packaged very well and there are plenty of metal shelves."

B00009W3HD,"Deflecto Dryer Lint Trap Kit, Supurr-Flex Flexible Metallic Duct",Major Appliances,2,This product is pretty much a piece of junk. They state it comes with a 5' hose but it's more like 3'. Not even long enough to mount the lint trap on the wall above the dryer. I have it sitting on the floor next to dryer. The zip ties are also total crap and do not secure the hose to the dryer or lint trap. I had to use zip ties. I'm not returning it because I need it for now but I'd recommend a different lint trap if you need one of these type products due to no exterior vent.

B00G9EHGDK,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine Pan30 Drain By Gravity,Major Appliances,4,"I bought this somewhere else but I LOVE this machine. if you take it with a grain of salt that it is portable and not perfect.... you will love it. Things I learned and adjust to mentally before attempting to wash anything...... It does small loads so i deal with it. Maybe like 5 pieces of light weight clothing and a few socks or underwear thrown it. When you switch a full washer load to the spinner it take 2 separate spin load to do the one wash load in spinner. If you do long jeans its only gonna take like 2 pairs of adult size. Forget even attempting towels unless your desperate and have small towels. in tat case you can do maybe 2 lightweight bath towels tops. They just get to darn heavy loaded with water. Use a TEASPOON of LOW sudsing HE detergent TOPS , no more. Anymore and you will do like 3 rinses and possibly more depending on how much soap. Seems crazy but its true. Even one teaspoon of regular detergent will suds you up like crazy if all you have is regular I would do like half a teaspoon. Things like bras  or delicates need to go in a mesh bag first or you will have a twisted ripped mess .  DON't trust the hoses on your sink faucet end. Yeah yeah yeah they might hold one time and not the next... just hold it at the faucet end while filling , it only takes like 2 minutes. If you can use this IN the bathtub all will be golden. No worry about spills or mishaps or hoses slipping. have a hand held shower head and your REALLY golden for easy filling. DON't forget to get something like a rubbermaid tote lid to elevated bottom a bit from bottom of tub to avoid over soaking base too much. HUGE TIP..... if you use soap correctly and don't over soap... you can EASILY just do your rinse in the spinner. Just switch your water hose to the spinner side and run water in the first part of your spin cycle then drain for the rest of your spin cycle. This saves the whole step of having to do the whole rinse do-over after washing in the washing side. This step only works formostly  NON HEAVY items and not over suds stuff. Last but not least...Are you short on SPACE or storage? Keep this thing on a porch or patio or balcony. Just keep covered in a large tote or  something  to keep elements out. You can even RUN IT outside if you use a bucket to fill the wash side and use a big bucket for the drain when draining. I found a big Rubbermaid cooler works great if you have one of those anyway. So all that said... YES its somewhat a pain but YES does the job if you need it and figure out your best plan of attack with trial and error. GREAT for doing even your lightweight stuff at home to save moneyf and then saving your heavy stuff for the  laundromat. IT REALLY DOES WASH AND SPIN WELL...if used correctly."

B00DEQCZCS,"LG LDG3036ST Freestanding Gas Range, 30-Inch, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,2,"My wife and I purchased an LG stove (LDG3036ST) in May 2015. We are happy with the mechanical performance of it. In July 2015, a piece of ceramic covering the front part of the stove fell of (ie black strip in the top front of the stove). We did not hit it, bang it or impact it to result in the ceramic piece falling off. We called LG and they declined to fix it based on it being a 'cosmetic defect'. Even though they acknowledged the possibility that the product might be defective, because it is cosmetic, they won't fix it. We paid $1500 for this stove, and two months later, a ceramic piece breaks off, but LG won't fix it. To me, that's terrible customer service. I cannot recommend purchasing this stove, nor do I recommend purchasing any LG products. If you do purchase it, be sure to buy a warranty, as that might save you a lot of frustration and dollars. But overall, I don't plan to purchase any LG products in the future. This company cannot be trusted."

It holds a fairly large size load (not as large as my old dryer which was a full size one, but really I had no business stuffing so much in that one like I did anyway. This dries a normal size laundry load.  If your load doesn’t fit in it, you are probably overloading your washer.)  I can fit a king size quilt in there no problem."

Super Quite. When the W is dispensing the soap from the tray, it pulses the water which causes the hoses and pipes in the wall to jump and clank. $10 water arrester will solve this tho. Definitely not a deal breaker! Great Price and I haven't noticed any missing features compared to the $2600 sets. Except maybe WiFi. And well that's just silly! Steam feature is great AND washer door has a &#34;stand-out&#34; magnetic feature that keeps the door slightly propped open to allow the interior to dry and limit the mildew smell.

I read the reviews and I don't have time for stuff that doesn't work or fit or last. The isntructions were easy to follow and everything went right into place. The hardest part was getting the original plastic retainer triangles for the drum roller off.  I just ended up cutting them.  This was really an improvement over my model's original equipment as mine did not come with a tension roller.  The original tensioner was just a curved metal channel on a spring so the belt rubbed against it constantly. Even so, the original belt lasted over ten years."

We did hear that some people had problems with a drain tube in the freezer area that was too stiff, but we never experienced any problems ourselves.  We did purchase the five year extended warranty which I'm sure won't be needed now that we bought it...I also always recommend that you purchase two refrigerator / freezer thermometers from your local hardware store (less than $10 per each) to check / monitor the actual temperatures in both the freezer and refrigerator...these will be a great investment."

B000JLNBW4,Koolatron Coke Personal Mini Fridge,Major Appliances,4,"Nice little fridge to have in your room or office. but of course it will not chill drinks as fast as a fully sized fridge. Given a night it will cool the drinks inside of it to a decent temperature.<br /><br />Fits 6 regular soda cans, 4 16 oz water bottles, anything taller then a 16 oz water bottle will not fit upright and anything water will not fight 4 bottles or 6 cans.<br /><br />This item is more a novelty gift for a collection or something, would be better suited to keeping things cool as the cooling is a joke compared to ice or a real fridge.<br /><br />If you've got this in your room and have a fan or pc on or anything that makes ambient noise you will not notice this unit's noise at all. The size is about the size of a sub woofer. The durability of this machine concerns me a little bit so i am not expecting it to last too long."

We couldn't believe how much laundry the little guy was creating! We have a tiny apartment and it was just too much working going to the laundromat with a baby. I had blisters on my hands from washing things in our tub and wringing them to dry around the house. This product has been a life saver. We can wash a lot of baby clothes in it at one time. I can also do an entire set of sheets from a queen sized bed. It's not as easy as the traditional washer that washes and spins in the same compartment, but for apartment life (especially with a baby) this has been super useful."

B00ENOTOA6,GE PSA9120SFSS Profile Advantium 1.7 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Over-the-Range Microwave - Convection,Major Appliances,5,"We've had this unit for over a year. It has taken awhile to appreciate all that it is capable of and we are still learning. The included programming is super, but you can and will need to work with it to get everything right or at least to your taste. I do wish the racks used for baking were sturdier; they will bend to scary points when you load them with large casserole dishes. The cooking, however, is grand. If you have downsized from a full-feature kitchen with wall ovens and all that - this might relieve a bit of your grief. If you are planning on self-install, it is VERY heavy and will likely take 3 people to manage that (or a magician) - two to lift it into place and a third to set the bolts above it.<br /><br />Bottom line - this isn't just a microwave, it is a smaller multipurpose oven that can often eliminate the need of using your larger oven in the range under it. It won't do a 20lb turkey, but 10-11 will work, so most of your lower back-ailing work can be shifted up top for the bulk of your oven deeds."

Going to a stackable washer and dryer means that one of the previously mentioned hookups is going to be in the wrong place.<br /><br />I did not feel like paying to relocate the 240 line or using long hoses for water... The easier thing to do was to get a longer power cord. You cannot find these in Lowes or Home Depot or even the place we bought them. What a pain...<br /><br />Luckily, this cord did the trick  giving me the extra few feet needed to reach the power socket and have the stacked units in front of the water hookup. It was easy to install."

The Max Sear seeing has 2 qts water boiling in about 5 mins.  We use this in our toy hauler and runs great off or solar / battery /inverter package. Only comment is if you fry eggs, be sure to watch your temp setting because it will sear the outside and leave the inside very runny (white part) if the temp is too high."
B00IYZOXOW,"Samsung WF45H6300AW Energy Star 4.5 Cu. Ft. Front-Load Steam Washer with PowerFoam Technology, White",Major Appliances,1,"SAMSUNG WASHERS ARE JUNK.  We purchased a similar model in Feb 2011 and less than 4 years later the thing started making an awful racket.  I had a repair technician make an assessment and the costs to repair the thing is a tad over $900.00.  The repair items are: bad bearing, and an out of round wash tub.  I have called their customer assistance (help) line and they said I could purchase an &#34;extended warranty&#34; for $250.00 that might cover the needed repairs.  I have sent 2 letters to the Samsung Corporate Office in NJ in Feb and again in April-and as of yet No reply.  I refuse to spend another penny on an appliance that cost over $1000.00 and then cost over $900.00 to repair within 4 years of purchase.  We are a small family, the washer does the equivalent of 1 load a day. I have light bulbs that last longer.  I have attached a copy of the repair estimate in the photo.  I would honestly rate this as negative 10 stars.  4 years ago, I sold a working 15 year old Whirlpool washing machine and I regret it."

I needed it in order to survive a kitchen reno and it has really come in handy for that.<br /><br />Plus:<br />+ It's quiet! Even small refrigerators are notorious noise-makers, but this one makes only a subdued whirr when it runs.<br />+ It's not going to fit a ton of stuff, but it stores more than I thought.<br /><br />Minus:<br />- Frost builds up very quickly on the freezer section.<br />- The temperature is not even throughout the fridge. Items stored on the handy little tray under the freezer section tend to freeze, but if you set the temperature control lower to avoid this, the rest of the items in the fridge do get cold enough.<br />- The room for tall standing items doesn't fit much more than a one quart carton of milk or one wine bottle. There is room for 2 bottles to be laid on their sides on the shelves, but the shelf space is lost."

Unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to its claims.  It just doesn't cool down to the temps we want, even if we set it to do just that!  It has gotten worse and now rarely can I get it to cool below 50 degrees.  It was a disappointment."
B000R9CFIY,Broan 30-Inch Elite Ultra Quiet Range Hood,Major Appliances,4,"This hood really moves some air.  I didn't find installation of the device itself to be particularly troublesome, though there were some spots that weren't overly compatible with my cabinets (that's no fault of the manufacturer, just something I should have measured) and the ductwork was troublesome to install (again, that's on me and my house).  Once installed, the thing is nicely quiet at low speeds while still moving a decent amount of air, and really clears things out at high speeds while still being quieter than even the low speed of the old microwave &#34;vent fan&#34; that just pushed air around the kitchen.<br /><br />The hood itself is great for the most part, but there are a few things about it I didn't like so much that I docked it a star:<br /><br />- The buttons don't always respond to a quick press even when it &#34;clicks&#34;, which is infuriating when you're frantically turning the fan up in the kitchen after you've forgotten to turn it on and set off the smoke alarm.<br />- The relays are kind of noisy (this is, obviously, a bit of a nitpick).<br />- The recessed bulbs (MR16 GU10 halogen or LED) are a little hard to remove, especially once they're greasy.<br /><br />It's otherwise a really great unit that we love, and it does its job admirably.  A few things to be aware of before buying it:<br /><br />- Like any high-capacity vent hood, you probably need a make-up air unit to compensate for the air being sucked out of your house so it doesn't get sucked in through your furnace vent instead.  In my case, our old house is leaky enough that it wouldn't have made a difference, but once we get the leaks plugged (since that has direct implications on our utility bills), we'll need to install one.  It can be a bit of a task.<br />- If you're tempted to replace the halogen bulbs with LEDs to reduce the energy use or increase their lifespan, make sure you pick ones that dim nicely.  The ones that we tried (from Triangle) didn't have much of a difference between dim and bright, and had noticeable 60 Hz &#34;ghosting&#34; when on the dimmer settings; it was bad enough that we're back to the halogens for now.  We'll try some others.<br />- When you install it, if the fan seems to be scraping against the metal, make sure it's all the way on its post; ours shifted in shipping and I thought there was something defective or damaged about the unit, but it turned out that I just needed to shove it back on so it was on center.  It should spin freely and quietly when it's correct.<br />- This unit generally requires a hard-wired branch circuit, so make sure you can provide that.  You could theoretically wire-nut a power cord to it, but that's for chumps.<br /><br />All in all, I really love this unit with the exception of some minor annoyances that I'm willing to get past.  If you have a high output stove, you should absolutely consider this one.ween dim and bright, and had noticeable 60 Hz &#34;ghosting&#34; when on the dimmer settings; it was bad enough that we're back to the halogens for now.

B002UYSHMM,Haier HLP21N Pulsator 1-Cubic-Foot Portable Washer,Major Appliances,5,"I purchased this washer as a last resort before I went bonkers with trying to jockey for position in the apartment laundry room (there is one woman here who does at least 10 loads of laundry DAILY..!) Since I have had this wonderful machine for the past year, I have been able to keep up with all the laundry, and still enjoy my life!<br /><br />One secret to using this that I learned is to turn off the water after the wash water has all flowed in; that way, if you want to put in fabric softener, but you don't want to hang out over the machine, it will make a beeping sound when it needs more water for the rinse cycle and will not continue until you turn the water back on! Otherwise, you can time about 15 minutes for the wash cycle, keep the water on, and hope you don't get involved in anything more important.<br /><br />Another tip: I hang my clothes to dry, and I have discovered that it is helpful for faster drying to spin dry the clothes twice.<br /><br />Yet another tip: TURN OFF THE FREAKING WATER BEFORE YOU REMOVE THE WATER HOSE FROM THE SINK SPOUT. Yeah, we have learned the hard way. Make sure to turn it off and NOT remove the hose for a little bit, then place a towel over the connection as you remove it if you really don't want to take a shower at that moment.<br /><br />And, finally, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE DRAIN HOSE IN THE SINK AND FIRMLY DOWN THE DRAIN PIPE. Unless, of course, you want to wash your floors that day.<br /><br />I LOVE this washer and am very pleased with my purchase. It has improved the quality of my life considerably!"

I have been in Amazon customer for over 15 years, and have ordered well over six figures worth of merchandise from it. The first time I ordered this unit, after it had been delayed for over a week, I contacted the supplier, which informed me at that point that the item was on back order. That did not keep them from having charged my credit card upon receiving my order. My second experience was even worse. I ordered the item, and it did arrive on time, but, as I was distracted with my kitchen remodel, I assumed that because it worked when plugged in it was OK. Only after the delivery man left, did I noticed it was bulgin on one side and dented on the other. It does not fit in the slot that we had built  for it. Unfortunately, as I was too trustingand signed off on the delivery, i have zero recourse except to pitch it into a dumpster and try again. Again: the lesson learned is: never, ever, ever order an appliance through Amazons associates."

The good news:  this version is a VAST improvement of the last GE in this size.  It's only a little taller than the last on the interior, but that little bit makes a huge difference:  we can now fit virtually everything we need in the microwave.  They added on some other features that bring this microwave into this century (turn table, more auto settings, etc.).

B0084IXCN2,Samsung WA400PJHDWR 4.0 cu. ft Large Capacity Top Load Washer,Major Appliances,1,"We had our washer for almost 2 years! And it had to be serviced 2x!!!!! The 1st time it was serviced we had it for a little over 9 months. The water pump was busted.<br /><br />Just recently the machine has been reading a dc message and the spin cycle starts over and over again! During one wash the cycle ran almost 5 hrs! Thanks for saving me water and energy!!!<br /><br />Today the service guy came out to fix it he was 40 mins late when he got to my home he looked at the washer (i mean only looked) and said the shocks were bad and we needed 2. Let me remind you he hasn't even pulled the washer from the wall or opened it up! He quoted me a total price of $249. He was told to do the work. when he went to pull the washer from the wall he said to me oh you need to take this washer out of the pan you have it in. I looked at him like he was crazy so me and my 18 month old daughter was supposed to take this washer out of the pan really? I said I can't take the washer out! Than he said will I can't work on it because is may crack. I told him to crack the pan I didn't care just fix the washer. He refused and left my house. So let me get this straight I miss several hours of work, I had to deal with a rude service person and my washer is still broken!<br /><br />I called Samsung and told them what happened and all they did was set me up with another service provider. I'm still trying to figure out why I've only had this washer almost 2 years and it needs service already!!! Keep your money and buy something else! This washer isn't worth it!!!"

B00NVGA0Z0,"The Laundry Alternative Miniwash Portable, Compact Mini Washing Machine (Blue) with 3 Year Full Warranty",Major Appliances,4,"I bought this about 2 months ago and have been using it about twice a week since then. I live in a studio apartment without a washer so this is my main washing machine and overall I really like it. It cleans clothes well and doesn't take up too much space on my bathroom counter. It can actually hold more clothes per load than I thought it would.<br /><br />My only complaint is that after washing dark clothes the motor blades will have a slight blue tint to them. At first I could run a load with a little vinegar and the color would disappear. Now, the blue tint is permanent. Washing it just lights it up. The color doesn't come off on other clothes so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />TIPS:<br /> - Soak delicates in warm soapy water for 20 minutes before starting the machine<br /> - Every few weeks run a load with cold water and 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to clean the machine<br /> - One wash cycle, two rinse cycles is usually best<br /> - After the wash cycle and 1st rinse cycle, lightly wring out the clothes to get rid of excess soapy water<br /> - If clothes are still really soapy after rinsing or are really stiff after air drying , decrease the amount of soap you are using. I typically use 2  teaspoons of soap for 1 load."

B001QLAQGU,"Haier RWT350AW 3.1 Cubic Feet Top Load Agitator Washer, White",Major Appliances,3,Overall I like this I have the set. Only problem is the fabric softner doesn't release til the spin cycle so it leaves it on your clothes I find I have to jst do the downy ball or add it by hand other than that it washes great let's u know when done and is quite just wish the fabric softner release would work right. The dryer I have is not stainless like the washer and has been chipping. it does what it should and from going to not having one to having one I like it. I got it new at a scratch and dent place for $200 for the set & If I could buy it again for that price I would but if I had to pay more than that just for one Id buy something else.

B006L8PYQU,DishDrawer Series DD24DCX7 24&quot; Semi Integrated Double Drawer Dishwasher with 14 Place Settings 9 Wash Cycles Adjustable Racks Delay Start Eco Option Energy Star Approved in Stainless,Major Appliances,2,"My Fisher Paykel broke after 4 years.  I think I was lucky since others experienced failure long before that.  The drawers limit the size of the dishes you can put in them.  I actually had to get rid of an entire set of square dishes because the dinner plates would not fit in the drawers.  You really have to have standard sized or smaller dinner plates.  If you have plates as little as a half inch bigger in diameter than standard then they will not fit into a drawer.  The one I had explicitly forbade the use of dishwashing tablets - I like using tablets so that made me sad.  I had to extensively pre-clean dishes before I put them into the dishwasher but I do that anyway regardless of brands.  I like the drawer concept but there were so many things that I couldn't put in the drawers due to their size limitations that I just replaced my Fisher Paykel with the top of the line Bosch (40 dB) which has the wonderful concept of a 3rd rack at the very top of the dishwasher (which is perfect for long handled cooking utensils) and is so quiet that they have to provide a light aimed at the floor to let you know when it is running. However, the door, when opened, does take up more kitchen space effectively dictating where I located my small island.  With my new Bosch, I can load all my dishes, pans, pots, sheets without worry because the bottom rack has plenty of clearance space now.  If I were to consider a drawer in the future, it would be located in an outdoor kitchen or in a pantry outside a formal dining room as a supplement to the &#34;doored&#34; dishwasher in the kitchen and it would not be a Fisher Paykel but another brand."

B0028MOZI6,Avanti SHP1712SDC-IS 1.7-cu.-ft. AC/DC Superconductor Refrigerator,Major Appliances,2,I bought this to replace my popup campers fridge. The camper has a 12 fan and 110 fan that runs and the temp around the fridge was always 70. And 4 inches around. And 12 in the back. It ran fine out of the camper but could not work in the campers original whole. I gave it a 2 stars BC I liked the inside light. It soon would not get below 47 degrees. I live close to the camper capital of America. Elkhart Indiana. And I went to a surplus store and got a three way band new fridge for $300. This unit I left at a good will area.

B00FGWUA34,Bosch WAP24200UC 300 2.2 Cu. Ft. White Stackable Front Load Washer - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"This washer is terrible. The only wash cycle that seems to actually clean clothes is the &#34;sanitize&#34; cycle, which is too way hot for most clothing and takes 2 hours to complete. All other cycles leave clothes smelly. The fundamental problem with this unit is that it DOES NOT USE ENOUGH WATER. It uses barely just enough to spread the sweat and grime from your dirtiest clothing to your cleanest clothing, and then to mix it all together in a nice frothy brew. There is no setting that allows you to select the water level. Let me say that again: the owner of this $1000 unit does not have the right to select the water level. Un-friggin-credible. It's like this PoC was designed in Washington, DC. There is no way to get your clothes clean using this product. You will find yourself replacing this unit with one that actually works, like a used top loader. Fight the power!"

B00AF7U2VA,"LG Refrigerator Water Filter (5231JA2002A, LT500P)",Major Appliances,2,"After installing this filter, we rarely drink the filtered water as we felt the water is not as good as the original one when we purchased the refrigerator. It tastes differently and sometimes felt stomach pain, which may not directly caused by this filter. We are not sure what caused the problem. As a result, we almost never drink this filtered water again after replacing the original one."

We really like the 2 drawer concept when we were but 2 people.  It would take us a week to fill an entire dish washer!  Now that we are a family of 4, the concept still works well for us, living out of one drawer while filling the other ;).  Seriously though, its much quieter than out original and works very well.  The newer display takes a little getting used too."

Like others have said, the new machines take 2 or 3 times as long to wash, use more energy not less, don't wash very well, and the lid locks and doesn't want to let you open it no matter what. I will never, ever, ever buy a Maytag again."

B002MPLYEW,"Danby 120 Can Beverage Center, Stainless Steel DBC120BLS",Major Appliances,1,"Loud and Hot.<br /><br />Those are arguably the two worst words you can hear when considering a fridge. This fridge is both. I've yet to have problems with the temperature it keeps the drinks - however the fridge itself is extremely hot, searing to the touch on the outside. It causes everything around it to get extremely warm, which makes it terrible for small rooms or spaces - the places you want a mini fridge.<br /><br />Loud. This fridge is ridculously loud. Even on carpet, even on a Matt on carpet, this fridge is really really loud. I believe it is the compressor in the back that makes the noise but I'm far from the only one complaining about this unit's noise. Just somethings to consider before purchasing."
B00JV8G2XG,Bosch HMV5052U 500 2.1 Cu. Ft.

Customer service is a joke. BOSCH has gone WAY down hill. I'm not happy with their dishwasher either, I suspect they spinned off their appliance division to some one else, Bosch was 15 years ago the BEST, now they're the worst. Stay away from their  products."

My sister-in-law tried to warn be about it as she hates hers also but it was too late. It is absolutely impossible to load. The entire right half of the dishwasher is set up with teeny tiny slats that perfectly fit a tiny tea saucer or very tiny dessert plate...a dozen of them. Cannot imagine what on earth you would use that area for. The top where the glasses go, is too high and does not accommodate a normal sized glass and certainly not wine glasses even on the lowest rack setting. Also, who cares how &#34;quiet&#34; this is if it takes a MINIMUM of 2 HOURS and 6 minutes to clean. SO unhappy our appliance guy talked us into this."

B004WP4CV2,"Samsung WA5451ANW 27 Top-Load Washer 4.7 cu. ft. Capacity, 1,100 RPM Stainless Steel Diamond Drum",Major Appliances,1,"I would give this product minus 5 stars if I could.  This by far has to be the worst clothes washer ever, piece of expensive junk.  It’s supposed to be a high efficiency machine so they took it to the extreme, there is barely enough water in most cycles to clean the clothes, they come out dirty and don’t smell fresh.  I have found a way around this, I use “towel” cycle to do my regular washes, but so much for high efficiency!  The real problem with this machine however is how it literally ties everything in knots!  Everything comes out extremely wrinkled and wrapped together, and I am not exaggerating when I liken it to untangling a ball of cables!  All the pant legs come out knotted in a huge ball.  After each load you are untangling this mess, trying to shake out the wrinkles!  If you don’t untangle the mess, everything comes out pressed like an accordion, so you actually have no choice!  Do we need to make doing the laundry more unpleasant??  Samsung has succeeded, you will have to work very hard after each load untangling and shaking each piece just to be able to throw your clothes into the drier.<br />So as if this is not bad enough, my machine started rusting along the bleach dispenser after ONLY 1.5 years of use (see picture below)!!  There are other parts rusting as well, like above the detergent dispenser drawer.  Of course neither the regular warranty nor the extended warranty we bought cover this issue! They tried to tell me it’s over use – I laugh, a washing machine that cannot handle water, imagine that!  By the way, I hardly EVER use bleach and I do a wash once or twice a week.  Pretty sad and pathetic.<br />I would AVOID this machine like a plague.  We are stuck with it and I am trying to find ways around its shortcomings which are plenty.  I am actually looking forward to the day it will completely die, which should be fairly soon!  Samsung should stick to making cell phones!!!"

I was a little worried about space at first but once It came and I went to fill it up I was amazed at how much I could fit into it. I was even able to fit my larger soup pots with minor finagling. I run mine 1-3 times a day, I use only the Eco setting and it cleans them perfectly. Uses minimal water and electricity. It has been the best investment we've made."

First time started about 8 months after I purchased it.  Water was just free flowing from the dispenser.  Luckily I was just at work so I caught it pretty quick but if I'd been gone on vacation it would have destroyed my kitchen.  I got it repaired under warranty, the repair company was good to work with but it took them 3 tries.  First time they had to order a mother board.  2nd time the repair part was also broken.  Now about 15 months in, it's leaking from the bottom.  I can't see where it's coming from, but it was just pooling along side my cabinets and has caused extensive damage.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS FRIDGE."

If more than one person in your family likes ice in their drinks, this is not the unit for you.  It will never keep up.

I needed one for my office and this fits perfectly underneath my L-shaped desk.  I have an ice block that I bring into work frozen and this keeps it frozen. I tried feezing it from the beginning of the day, but it did not freeze all the way through by the end of the day (9 hours).  Still serves my purpose well, though.  It chills beverages very quickly. The inside is a good size. I'm glad my husband talked me out of the 1.7 cubic sized ones. This one is just slightly bigger, but doesn't take up too much room. Perfect for the office."

B00T6OB50A,"Speed Queen AWN432SP 26"" Top Load Washer with 3.3 cu. ft. Capacity, in White",Major Appliances,5,"We needed to replace our Maytag washer and dryer of 37 years (still running, but a bit noisy).  Of course Maytag is now cheap junk and we never would consider purchasing it in it's current form.  Did a lot of research and finally settled on Speed Queen because of their extraordinary quality. Not just the outer appearance, but because of the top grade components used throughout. (How many other washers offer a lifetime warranty on the inner and out tub)?  I was against front loaders because of all the problems that others are having, (mold, will not unlock with done, more service required, lack of being able to service properly and get manufacture to honor warranty, not washing clothes properly requiring two or more re-washes, etc., etc. etc.).  Wife chose another top loader as we are getting older and she doesn't like bending over. One excellent selling feature was she was able to reach to the bottom of the tub while standing flat-footed on the floor (she's 5'-4&#34;). Many other top-loaded brands needed a step stool to reach the bottom of the tub, something to seriously consider before you buy.  Nice large agitator which turns 210°. (Some we looked at had a tiny, little nub which they called an &#34;agitator&#34;. Don't make me laugh, they couldn't wash a dish rag properly.)  Interior and exterior basket is made from high quality stainless steel. (Way to tell if it's high quality stainless (308, 316 grade) is to take a fridge magnet along and test it. A magnet will NOT stick to high quality stainless, it WILL stick to low quality stainless.)  Has a three year warranty on complete washer. (Some we looked at have only a 90 day warranty. Three months! What a joke. If the manufacturer doesn't believe in their product, why should I be expected to)? Five years on cabinet steel, motor and fifteen years on transmission. Inner and out tubs carry a lifetime warranty.  &#60;And it's made in America&#62;  We bought from a local dealer as we wanted to have a local service agent available should it require service, and for proper installation. However, if your modestly inclined, you shouldn't have any problems installing. Remember it weighs a couple of hundred pounds before you order.  Overall she loves it. Everything about it. It's quiet, works perfectly, cleans well and fast. I've never used it, but like its simplicity and quality of materials. No negatives whatsoever. We expect it to well out live both of us. Now, that's saying something."

B00KVPU108,"SPT RF-244SS Compact Refrigerator, Stainless, 2.4 Cubic Feet",Major Appliances,5,"I bought this refrigerator for my bedroom and it is the perfect size for my little room. I like how you can reverse the direction the door swings. Instructions in the manual are clear and easy to follow. The only thing I didn't like is how rough the original holes were drilled into the top.  I had to hammer the edges down a bit so that the covers would sit flush with the top of the unit.<br /><br />Temperature-wise, at first I thought it wasn't cooling enough with the temperature control set midway so I turned the temperature control all the way to maximum. I came home today to find the drinks I had outside of the tiny freezer had frozen. I also put some frozen steaks in the freezer and placed one on the tray below the freezer to thaw.  The steak I left on the tray is still frozen solid 3 days after I put it there. I guess its time for me to turn the temperature control down to a lower setting.<br /><br />This is a very quiet refrigerator. The only thing you'll hear is a distinct pop whenever the compressor turns on. The compressor itself is so quiet that you'll only hear it if you try and listen for it after you hear the pop. I don't know if that pop is normal but it happens all the time."
B00G9EHGDK,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine Pan30 Drain By Gravity,Major Appliances,4,I got my panda machine today and love it.  I havent stop using it.  Haha. I gave it 4stars rather than 5 because the one thing i sont like about it is the way it drains.  In order for it to drain completely it has to be down flat. What i did was set it on my counter top connected the tube to fill the water with the drain tube and placed a bucket ob the floor..so far its been working for me. Other than this no other complains.

B005DKRU32,Kegco Kegerator Full-Size Keg Cooler,Major Appliances,2,"I want to express my dissatisfaction with your product, and furthermore the support for your products. I had this kegerator purchased as a gift and the product worked great for 22 months before I experienced a total product failure. Upon calling the customer support line I was advised to call a “recommended” local service technician. The local tech had never heard of this brand. Furthermore upon calling the local repair technician, I was also told that I had to deliver the product for a diagnosis and there would be a $125 charge simply for diagnosis of the problem. I was also told that I could not use your supplied replacement compressor, and that I needed to purchase one from them if they determined the compressor to be the issue. I was able to test and identify the issue was a compressor failure and called back into Kegco where I was still advised that I must spend $125 for diagnostic from a local repair service, and I had to provide an invoice from the repair technician indicating the compressor was the problem.<br />Overall, I am dissatisfied with the product and lack of support. I understand there is a limited one year warranty, but no product under normal use in a climate controlled location, should have this type of catastrophic failure within 2 years.  I understand that products malfunction and lemons exist, but even after diagnosing the issue and being willing to repair it myself, I still must come out of pocket to verify what I have diagnosed. My group of friends purchases kegerators as wedding gifts for each wedding, and we will be going elsewhere with our business from here on."

B009WSPRUE,"LG WT1101 4.3 Cu. Ft. Ultra Large Capacity High Efficiency Top Load Washer with SlamProof,",Major Appliances,2,"Have you ever used a product and thought, &#34;Did the person who designed this ever actually use it?&#34;  That is the thought I have every time I use this disappointing washer.<br /><br />I've owned this machine for about 6 months.  I wish that I had not bought it.  My biggest beef is that it just doesn't get my clothes as clean as my old Maytag agitator model that I bought about 15 years ago (for 1/2 the price of this one, by the way.)  I have to pre-treat even the simplest stains or they are still there at the end of the wash cycle, so you should prepare to spend 10-15 minutes getting each load ready to wash.  Even using twice the recommended amount of detergent doesn't seem to help.<br /><br />If you want to use a liquid fabric softener, you have to select a special option when you are selecting the wash cycle.  Unfortunately, you cannot select the pre-soak option in the same cycle as the fabric softener option.  It's either pre-soak, or dispense fabric softener, but not both.  Who can possibly have thought this was a good idea?  In addition, the fabric softener dispenser is right next to the soap dispenser, and often times the fabric softener is actually dispensed with the detergent in the wash, where it does no good.  I have taken to adding the softener by hand during the rinse.  This is crazy.  Didn't other manufacturers figure out 30 years ago how to build an automatic softener dispenser that works?<br /><br />The machine goes through a great number of gyrations to agitate your clothes.  Unfortunately, these gyrations really twist your clothes around.  I have had dress shirts come out of the washer with their arms literally tied together in knots.  My cotton clothes are so wrinkled by the extreme gyrations that I have to iron much more than I did with my old washer.<br /><br />My old Maytag had a really good system for removing pet hair and other types of lint and leaving it behind in the wash tub.  This washer just forms little balls of fuzz and then deposits them back on your clothes.  Again, be prepared to inspect your clothes before you put them in the dryer so you can remove the lint balls.<br /><br />The machine does have a few pluses.  It seems to use very little water, but of course when your clothes are not cleaned, it's hard to see this as much of an advantage.  It has a huge capacity.  It holds a king size comforter that I used to have to take to a commercial laundry.  And the medium and high spin speeds extract a lot of water.  I guess I'm saving money running the dryer.<br /><br />All in all, however, a failed product.  I hope to replace it before the end of the year, and I cannot recommend.e prepared to inspect your clothes before you put them in the dryer so you can remove the lint balls.

B003L4Z57K,Generic Mini USB Fridge (RED),Major Appliances,4,"If you're considering purchasing this it's important to have realistic expectations and a full understanding of what you are buying. This is a tiny can sized USB powered can cooler/warmer. This is NOT an actual refrigerator. This cool looking device is a thermoelectric cooler. There is no compressor , no refrigerant, and no insulation. In other words, you can't expect this to give you an ice cold soda like a real refrigerator because it wasn't built to do that.  This will not MAKE your soda cold. . . it's not supposed to.<br /><br />So what is this device good for?  It's great for keeping an already cold soda or drink cooler a little longer. If you remove a cold soda from your refrigerator and put it in this mini fridge at your desk it won't get warm as fast.  It will still eventually warm to room temperature, just a little more slowly thanks to the cooling effect at the bottom of the can.  If you put a warm/room temperature soda in this and wait hours, you'll still have a warm/slightly less warm soda.<br /><br />How do I use it?<br />The aluminum bottom plate gets either hot or cold depending on what you have the switch set at. (Flip it one way and it cools.  Flip the switch the other way and it heats up.  Leave the switch in the middle position and the device stays powered off.<br /><br />For the cooling setting I like to put already cold sodas, drinks, fruits, fruitsnacks, candy bars etc. in this to keep them just a bit cooler longer. Of course I realize this isn't an actual refrigerator so I don't expect it to cool.<br /><br />If I have coffee in a small styrofoam cup the hot setting is great for slowing down the rate at which it cools to room temperature.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br />I was actually surprised at how cold and hot the aluminum plate gets to the touch.  I put a digital cooking thermometer probe on the baseplate and ran the device on both hot and cold for about 30 minutes to record temperatures.  In a room well above 75 degrees Fahrenheit the aluminum plate cooled to 25 to 30 degrees below the room temp.  I saw temperatures as low 40 some degrees which was pretty surprising.  I was also surprised at how hot the plate gets. I saw temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit and I was surprised because the plate gets almost to the point where it is too hot to put your hand on. Fortunately it stops just short of being so hot it's dangerous.<br /><br />Unfortunately these temperatures lead to false hope. These things are terribly inefficient and as cold or hot as the plate feels, it doesn't affect more than the bottom half inch or inc of the can or container.<br /><br />This is a great novelty item that works about as well as you should expect a USB powered cooler/warmer to work.  In my opinion if you pay $20 or less and like a fun novelty item for your desk go for it!  This will moderately slow down how fast your beverage cools or warms but don't expect miracles from a plastic toy made in China!um plate cooled to 25 to 30 degrees below the room temp.

B00J8NH71A,12v 6w Light Bulb Ge Fridge Water/ice Compartment,Major Appliances,4,"This works well.  I could not find a 12v 6w bulb at Home Depot.  This one works but is a little brighter (not necessarily a negative) because it does not have the metallic treatment on the glass that the original did.  I'm guessing the metallic glass on the original part diffused the light a bit so it doesn't look like a spot light coming out of your fridge door during night time hours.  4 stars for 90% perfect product, glad I could find this one though."

I've had it since early July 2015 and use it multiple times a week. I've had no problems what so ever and it usually takes 30 mins to dry. You can have up to 9lbs of laundry. It is super quiet as well. I have it running now and can barely hear it. You have to clean the filter after each use and I could recommend a lint brush to clean it ( lots of dog hair in my filter). This dry needs to be well ventilated or it WILL NOT work properly because it needs to register the dampness in your clothes. I truly love this!! I did all though find this dryer cheaper elsewhere, but I had to review because of how happy I was!!"

B0017Y3GGI,"NewAir AI-100R 28-Pound Portable Icemaker, Red",Major Appliances,5,"We bought this for use in an RV.  It's worked flawlessly for 3 months now.  We make several bags of ice to store in the freezer, then pull this machine back out when we need more.  So we don't use it continuously.  As they advertise, we get our first ice within minutes of turning it on.  The tray fills up in less than an hour and we bag it for the freezer.  We took the icemaker to Disneyworld and used it to make ice continuously for 10 days.  That ice was used to keep drinks cold in a large 40-quart ice chest.  The icemaker worked great for this use although the quantity of ice we could produce was a little low for such a large ice chest.  Once we got the drinks cold, this icemaker made just enough ice to keep drinks cold.  We use distilled water to keep particulates out.  We primarily use the small &#34;cube&#34; setting because these are just right for drinking glasses.  So it's all about the quantity of ice that you need.  For relatively low usage for perhaps 2-3 people, this icemaker is what you need.  It's produces a low hum which isn't overly noisy except when ice is plunking into the tray every few minutes.  I'm very happy with this icemaker."

I bought the EasyGo washer to save on the cost of going to the laundromat, I have a 6 person family, so we accumulate a lot of laundry in a week, and this forces me to do laundry every day. I'm giving it 4 stars because of it's construction, the legs are made out of very flexible plastic. They haven't failed me yet, but as much as I use it, I feel they may fail sooner than later.

In addition, I did find here one other buyer who was kind enough to allow me to call her about her usage and she was wonderful in answering all my questions!  Yes, had to give away about 20 pots and pans but was able to keep a few.  The first week was a real learning curve for me (less so now, but still have room to learn more).  Every water item I boiled from full tea kettle to 3/4 full pot managed to boil over vociferously and so quickly, I learned to NOT EVER make a run to the ladies room!!!  Twice the top shut off when the water spilled all over the controls area - apparently it's quite sensitive (are they all like that?) - the book DOES warn about it.  It shouldn't happen again.  And it even went into control lock, but not sure if *I* caused that or the spilled water did.  Took a few min. before it would release but I think it was due to opr. error.<br /><br />I truly love this top.  I picked it due to four main factors:  price was $1K less than the Bosch ({I paid just less than 1K} - so, no timers on the burners, which I knew I wouldn't really use) and true, there's no 'official' bridge (but I had confirmed I could still bridge bet. two burners on the Frig. without issues but no heat in between - fine for me - I only bridge two burners when making sauces or gravies, which I'm always stirring and moving around anyway); the depth of this still allowed me to keep my 30\\"" wide utensil drawer directly below it, which was VITAL - (some units are deeper and would have prevented that); the largest - and front - burner is very \\""forgiving\\"" and will cook with pans most any size (some brands require very precise & exact pan sizes) - I've used from 6\\"" to 10\\"" sized pans on that largest burner without issues;  and, its overall look and burner placements.  I have no regrets whatsoever.  It cooks beautifully and so responsively, from \\""keep warm\\"" to full-blast power (1500W to 3400W - on high power).  I am absolutely loving induction cooking and also will already say I much prefer it over gas and wouldn't want to go back.<br /><br />I kept going to numerous websites and forums to confirm serious cooks' continued love of switching to induction - that was my biggest fear (regretting same).  But nope - I am soooo glad I did.  Things just in general cook faster and more evenly; I can go from full power to instant low in one second - the full roiling boil stops instantly.<br /><br />This has the up/down arrows with about 17-18 different heat levels, i.e. - 1 then 1.5, 2 then 2.5, etc. - the last three levels 7-8-9 are in whole increments, plus full blast power, of course - only used to bring liquids to a very fast boil - then you reduce your heat.  Some cooks here mentioned that they only want the sliding bar controls, not the up/down type.  But, for me: it's so fast & responsive when I change to a diff. power level that I honestly don't think it's any faster than the slide bar and I like that my cooktop looks less cluttered than having the long sliding bar a few others have.  I'd say it takes me 2 or so seconds to change from a very high pwr. to a very low, especially bec. I don't have to count all the way down from, say a 9 power to a 2.  If I was at 9 level, I'd then hit the down arrow which instantly brings me to level 1 and then just go up.  By holding my finger down on the arrows, it very rapidly (split seconds) raises or lower the levels; it would prob. be just as fast to hold my finger over the down arrow to reach level 2 just as quickly - it's that fast.<br /><br />You can only have TWO burners on full power/burst at one time - it shares the power so that's why - and is quite common, except for a few.  But, can't imagine ever needing more than two pots to bring to a full, roiling boil at the same time - unless you're delivering a friend's baby, I guess.  (Sorta like \\""Gone with the Wind\\"" perhaps?)<br /><br />My one observation of a critique:  I'm using, as I knew I would, mainly the largest burner on the right in the front - my preference for locale.  The leading perimeter edge facing the center of the cooktop seems to be heating at a slightly hotter temp. than the rest of the burner.  I notice food gets browner first and slightly more quickly along that far edge.  I made Swedish Pancakes today and it was noticeable.  I will call for service this coming week - it's modest but I'd like it remedied, though nothing I couldn't live with.<br /><br />FYI - from my research, using the Windex product called \\""Crystal Rain\\"" (clear lavender in color) cleans the top beautifully - I'm VERY pleased with it.  Spray and use a paper towel and the top glistens.  I love the smooth, glossy look of this top, no handles,  has stainless steel frame on two sides, takes seconds to clean instead of 20-25 min. to clean my former stainless gas top and the counter just looks so \\""neat and tidy\\"" now.<br /><br />Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions.

B001SAFQ8C,The Dishwasher Filtration System,Major Appliances,1,"This system works very well. We live in a very hard water area and my dishwasher was atrocioiusly gunked up with calcium deposits. I cleaned it all very carefully by hand using food grade acetic acid and it looked like new. Then I installed this filtration system and it worked like magic: the dishes are sparkling and the dishwaher stays nice and clean. So why only one stars Well, when you go to buy replacement filters (and I'm talking about buying them directly for Difi) it all gets sort of touch-and-go. If the company happens to have them in stock, all well and good. But my experience is they tend not to have them in stock. Even so, they are happy to take your money, keep you waiting for weeks and never communicate. On my last order, after 2 months, numerous emails from me to them and no answers,  I tried calling and the message box said: &#34;the message box is full, please hang up.&#34; At that point I was so fed up that I called my credit card company and had the charge reversed. Interestingly, that did finally elicit a response from them saying the order had been cancelled. No apology. No explanation. This is a company I won't be doing business with anymore."

B005ECTRE4,frigidaire cooktop,Major Appliances,5,"I thought I would write a little (well, not so little) about MY experience & costs since so few remarks or comments have been found here about this brand and model. I actually have the identical model but WITH two stainless steel bars along the right and left sides - Model FPIC 3095MS.  I've had it for about 10 days now.  Had to convert to 220 V., of course - that was about $650 cost with my DH helping the electrician  feed wires to the panel, through our wall and ceiling from the kitchen, through the garage ceiling and down to the panel outside - about 45 feet (Calif. charges - but really had to negotiate! - got estimates from $1200 to $800).  I had a gas cooktop prior.<br /><br />I am an avid and serious cook and research to death anything I'm considering.  I was wavering bet. the 30&#34; Bosch and this 30&#34; Frigidaire.

I'm clearly in my 'honeymoon' phase and will definitely update this down the line if anything crops up worthy of mention.<br /><br />Updated notes:  It's now 4 months of usage and I'm still very pleased!  I've a mixture of brands of pans that I have bought and I MUST tell you that my VERY favorite brands have been the Ikea ones!! - which are probably the least expensive.  There is just something that I really like with those.  The two I have are a 2 qt. and maybe a 5 qt. pan that my son gave to me (these are approx. two years old) from his stash.  Undoubtedly my favorites.  There's just something about their weight and cooking capability that I like very much and the clean-up of these particular pans is just very easy and I don't encounter any sticking of food.  They are solid stainless, not non-stick.<br /><br />I HAVE noticed, as I originally mentioned, that upon initial heat-up of a burner, that a certain small section of a burner seems to initially heat up much quicker than the rest of the burner, but within 2-3 min. or so, or less, it has evened out.  I.E. - if I'm boiling water, I'll notice that 25%, say, of the burner is producing the bubbles more quickly than the rest of the burner but suddenly there's a perfect circle of bubbles. Also want to add that when using the Windex Crystal Rain, after cleaning the top with it, there IS a bit of a film.  But, rubbing the top with a dry section of the paper towel or a tea towel immediately removes that &#34;residue&#34; and it's like shiny, black glass again.  Seeing the minute splatter of anything (I'm a bit OCD, can you tell?, lol) across the top when doing ANY cooking just reminds me of how much splatter any cooking produced on my previous, traditional gas cooktop that I didn't even notice before.  You have NO idea how dirty your current cooktop or stove top IS until you see what happens when you just fry an egg or some such little thing on this - OY! - had no idea how much food splatters across the top.  I so love the easiness of cleaning this.  In seconds, I'm DONE!!!<br /><br />Update after 13 mos. of use:  Still VERY happy with no complaints.  The speed when bringing liquids to a boil, the evenness of the cooking surfaces within the pan, the easier clean-up of pots and pans for some reason and ESPECIALLY the ease of cleaning the &#34;glass&#34; top within seconds is such a pleasure.  Love this!rly in my 'honeymoon' phase and will definitely update this down the line if anything crops up worthy of mention.<br /><br />Updated notes:  It's now 4 months of usage and I'm still very pleased!

Able to fill up with 32 regular size wine bottles.  Slide-out shelves makes it easier to find the wine you want.  Does not produce heat and it is very quiet.

B00MVVITWC,Freezer,Major Appliances,5,"Was a little hesitant to order this as a lot of the feedback mentioned damage to the product on arrival.  Went ahead anyway.  Don't know if the company took the comments about packaging seriously and improved it or not, but ours arrived in perfect condition.  We plugged it in as soon as it was unboxed and it has been running ever since.  We are pleased with the size, the quality and the performance thus far.  Haven't had it long enough to defrost or, indeed, to note buildup of either moisture or ice.  Live in Florida, but this freezer is for inside use.  Will revisit review later if necessary."

B00NG0FP7E,LG Over-The-Range Microwave Oven with 300 CFM Venting System,Major Appliances,2,"I had the older version 2083ST and it stopped working so I replaced it with this microwave - has identical size and older model does not exist.<br /><br />Two aspects were problematic from the prior model - one of the mounting screws was located in the wrong position, thankfully the wall bracket and one of the screws aligned perfectly. So had to drill one more screw. However, the two screws are not symmetrical i..e the distance from the sides of the microwave are different. This is bad engineering, as the center of gravity is not the center.<br />Second, the interior is grey, so we cannot be see the food cooking. Moreover, the bottom of the outside panel is tinted (or black) so unless you are 6 ft tall, you cannot see the very dark interior with very small light.<br />Further, the microwave arrived with the mounting bracket (which was located at the top of the microwave carton) bent; thankfully, we had the older one, we did not have to use it.<br />Overall, disappointed with LG design and there is no backward compatibility with older models."

It in NO WAY can fit 22lbs of anything.  Very misleading in that statement.  I also like the previous design better for how the machine turns on.  Closing the lid immediately turns it on and there is no timer so you have to stand there and watch it.  Also water drips out the bottom as soon as you put your item into it.  I don't like the water bowl catching system.  As I said, it's ok but I'm not overwhelmed with love for it."
B00H9HS3BK,LP 280187 8181684 285998 Whirlpool Kenmore Washer Drain Pump & Filter Assm,Major Appliances,2,"The washing machine I'm working on is a 10 year old Whirlpool Duet machine, due to the F02 error code I was getting more frequently even though it had not completely failed.  The replacement part for my machine is Whirlpool #280187, which this item is listed as a direct replacement for, however this is not necessarily the case.  However, it can be used, but only with modifications for my whirlpool duet.<br /><br />INSTALLATION:<br />If you have owned your washing machine for a while, you should be familiar with the clean-out tray attached to the pump unit. This is located directly behind the bottom front panel, remove the 3 star headed screws at the very bottom to remove this panel and access the pump & it's clean out.  Get a shallow tray to catch about 3-4 cups of water when you unscrew the front clean out tray.  I found it the least messy to remove the front screw & back to rubber grommets holding the pump down.  Lift up the pump, put a towel under & tray to catch the water then unscrew the large front catch tray to drain water.  Disconnect the power clip by flipping up the cover on the end of the motor (right side).  Use channel lock's to pinch the clips holding the two hoses & slide the hoses off.  Installation is the reverse process.  It's also a good time to check the hoses for any stray items such as coins, hair pins, toys, etc.<br /><br />DESIGN PROBLEM:<br />As others have noted with this replacement item the smaller exit tube is off by approximately 70 degrees to exit almost directly vertical, vs the factory item which is about 30 degrees from horizontal.  Since I couldn't twist the existing hose which attaches to this exit tube, I needed a fix to this problem to use this new item.<br /><br />THE FIX:  Basically, the fix is to use the old housing with the new motor.  To do this, I removed the 3 screws holding the electrical pump with impeller (grey), to the plastic pump housing (cream colored), which the inlet & exit hoses attach to.  (Don't forget to takea couple photos of the original pump before disassembly, for reference) Then gently separate the two by hand, note there is a gasket to prevent leakage between these two pieces so they come apart easily.  Do this for the new & old pump so you can install the OLD cream plastic housing to the NEW pump electric motor.  Use the screws from the original unit with the new pump & be careful to install the electric pump motor at the same rotational degree to the cream housing as originally built, also being careful with the gasket.  Don't over tighten the screws, it's plastic!  Now, with the new electrical pump with impeller is attached to the original cream housing (with clean out tray) install the hoses & finish all installation.  Perform a test load or rinse & spin cycle to make sure there aren't leaks.  Reinstall the front panel to finish.<br /><br />MORE NOISE:<br />After installation I did notice an increase in noise but nothing too dramatic, so I can live with this as our washer & dryer are in a separate mud room.  If your worried about the noise or the FIX described, get the factory original unit.  Over half of the total pump install time was spent doing this fix alone.<br /><br />SHIPPING:<br />Since the pump wasn't eligible for prime shipping and expedited shipping was over $15, I ordered it with the standard free shipping.  To my surprise it arrived in only a couple days to Montana.  Very impressive since well over half the time my Prime 2 day shipping is 3-5 days instead of the guaranteed 2.<br /><br />RATING:<br />Rating given is reflective of; 1) not being a simple plug & play replacement, 2) great shipping speed, and 3) product functionality.  If the pump performs well over time, the rating may go up.  Purchase price was approximately $56 a week ago."

B00T6OB50A,"Speed Queen AWN432SP 26"" Top Load Washer with 3.3 cu. ft. Capacity, in White",Major Appliances,5,"This is my favorite washing machine! I bought it 6 years ago when I had my own place. I currently live with extended family so my beloved Speed Queen is in storage. Which means that for now I am using my family's top rated new Whirlpool Duet HE washing machine. Let me say there is no comparison. The Speed Queen is a far better machine than the Whirlpool Duet. I work on a dairy farm, so I come home with the dirtiest, stinkiest clothes.  Farm clothes are a true test for any washing machine. The Whirlpool Duet HE machine has a hard time getting the manure off my clothes, even on the heaviest cycle. With the Whirlpool, I can still pick cow poop off my shirt sleeves after they are &#34;washed&#34;. Gross! Plus, the Whirlpool Duet takes forever, and the clothes often have to be rewashed. However, my Speed Queen could get the manure off my farm clothes the FIRST TIME! No stuck on manure. Just clean. Plus, the Speed Queen is very time efficient. I could get all my clothes washed in a matter of a few hours. This meant my laundry was done, and I could spend the rest of my day doing things other than laundry. The HE machines are so slow it takes all day to wash the same amount of clothes. I highly recommend a Speed Queen. It is a simple, straight forward washing machine. It does a great job. I can't wait until I get my own place again so I can hook up my amazing Speed Queen!"

B00F660POO,"GE GDF540HMFES 24"" Slate Full Console Dishwasher - Energy Star",Major Appliances,1,"We bought this dishwasher from Home Depot rather than Amazon, but wanted to give everyone our experience nonetheless. There appears to be quality issues with this model. The first one delivered had a defective door hinge that we detected just prior to installation. The helpful delivery people came back to pick it up and drop off a replacement machine. Shortly after they left we discovered the second machine had some broken stems which connect the plastic tub to the frame. We called and a few days later a third machine was delivered. At this point everyone including the delivery people decided to really give this third machine a close inspection. Sure enough, yet another defect was found. Some of the insulation on the junction box wires connected to the power cord was damaged, exposing bare copper wire. Left undetected, such a defect might have caused a  dangerous short circuit.  The problem could easily have been fixed by us with some heat shrink tubing. However the delivery people agreed that three defective machines in a row was indicative of a serious lack of quality control. The question raised in everyone's mind was what else could be wrong that cannot seen? What else could be broken but not revealed until after installation? Will this thing fail in a few weeks or soon after the end of warranty?  Reluctantly we decided to return this third machine and go for another model from a different manufacturer. We just ordered a Whirlpool WDF760SADB from Home Depot to be delivered next week. Hopefully it will be better quality.  In retrospect, we learned that the appliance division of GE was sold to AB Electrolux of Sweden for $3.3B in September 2014. In July 2015 the Justice Department sued in Federal Court to block the merger on grounds that the deal would hurt consumers. Morale at the GE appliance division must be terrible right now and the lawsuit just adds more uncertainty to their fate. The takeover, whether is happens or not, has most likely had a detrimental effect on quality control at the beleaguered appliance division. This consumer was adversely affected.  P.S. - We installed the Whirlpool on August 5 and it's running great. Also designed and made in the USA."

B00CEMRVXG,Frigidaire FGHC2331PF Gallery 22.6 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth Side-By-Side Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,2,IMPORTANT UPDATE:  Finally a technician came and resolved the problem!!!  The problem was caused by water splashing over the pour spout that pours water into the ice maker. Ice was forming behind the back panel causing the motor to labor (noisy) and eventually fail or the fan to break.  The solution was to put a plastic tube around the spout to direct the flow of water. He was the only technician out of 4 to offer this simple solution and he said its a design flaw in the product. I hope this helps. its a great fridge again now.   Original post: I  wish this fridge worked well because I really like it and it fits in my space. I'm on my 4th service call for this refrigerator because water leaks or overflows inside the back panel of the freezer from the tube that dispenses the water to the ice maker. Either the motor or the fan has broken on a few occasions and it turns out that it's because of this water dripping down the back from the ice maker. I tried to adjust the water pressure in order to make the water slower but it still over flows from the filling tube that leads to the ice maker. The problem is that ice builds up on the back of the fridge very quickly and pieces of ice will fall into the motor area.  Most recently a piece of ice broke the fan and caused an error code and stopped the cooling. This appears to be a flaw in the design and I've only recently figured out what was happening because the technician took apart the entire back and showed me what was going on.  I really hope they can resolve this on the next visit because it's really not acceptable.  if anyone else has a similar problem please let me know how you resolved it.

I had it delivered to my work place but I was not here when Fed Ex came. The package was badly damage but I was lucky that my washer was not damaged. UPS is so much kinder to there packages...I hate fedex period. I had a guest in the apartment so I tested it out in my kitchen at my bar sink. It will not drip at the hook up if you keep the connection as straight as you can. It did leak at the back at the the drain hole...I will call it that because I do not know what it is called. I fixed it by cutting a spacer to put between the two movable parts to make it tighter. I cut a a 1/16 tile to use as a spacer ... not a gasket...it it is a spacer between the two parts to make it more tight. That worked. I ordered the dryer too but it has not came yet. I am happy with my purchase but time will tell.

B00NO5WOIY,"LG LFXC24726S French Door Refrigerator, 24.0 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,1,"Let me start off by saying that I bought this from another retailer. I initially loved the look and functionality of my new fridge. Now 10 months old this is what I just experienced:<br /><br />My 10 month old french door refrigerator's fan starting making a loud noise. I looked up my problem on the internet and found that my unit has a know frost buildup issue. I called LG since it was still under warranty.  They diagnosed the unit over the phone and scheduled a service appointment for me. A new control panel was mailed out to me. The tech was supposed to be at my home between 8 am and noon yesterday. I received a phone call the night before confirming him for between 10 and noon. The tech did not show up until 1:05. He then proceeded to empty out my fridge, remove all of the shelves and the bins. The vent behind the veggie bin was encrusted with ice which he melted and chiseled away. Then the back panel inside was removed which revealed the entire coil frozen and encrusted with ice. It took until after 3 PM for him to melt all of the ice which resulted in my having towels both wet and dry all over the kitchen, a bucket for the excess water, not to mention my food, bins and shelves strewn about. The tech pulled out the fridge and replaced the control panel on the back. Then came the process of putting everything back together and putting all of the food back in. I then had to wash a load of towels and clean the fingerprints and streaks off of the stainless steel fridge. Well the first thing that I noticed was the once firm and solid bin holder now wobbles. But that is not the worse part, the worse part is that today, one day later, the fridge has begun to make the same sound and the ice is already forming around the vent. I was assured the the control panel (brain) would fix the problem. Well it seems to me that this is not the case and I know have to go through this again not knowing if the LG tech can figure out what actually is wrong. I called for another appointment and was told that as of now none is available for Monday or Tuesday so I have to call back on Monday to see when the next available appointment will be. Why should a new appliance have these issues? Why shouldn't an LG tech be able to diagnose and fix the problem on the first business? Why shouldn't I be able to get an immediate appointment for a return visit to rectify the problem? I'm regretting my decision to go with LG. I should have purchased a Samsung refrigerator. I own an LG Phone an LG smart TV and this refrigerator. I will never purchase another LG product again. Am I expected to miss another day of work to be available for service, suffer the mess and inconvenience of the repair process and then not know if after the second visit if it will be fixed or not?"

B00IUPJMDI,"LG LFC24770ST French Door Refrigerator, 23.6 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,1,"I would highly encourage anyone reading this to avoid purchasing any LG product, given our recent experience. A technician came out to fix our year-old refrigerator under warranty and proceeded to damage it beyond repair in the process. Now, LG will not provide us with a replacement. Here was our experience with them and their customer service.<br /><br />In March of 2014 we purchased a LFC25765ST French Door refrigerator. We received a great deal on the fridge at a price of $1,367. In July of 2015, the fridge suddenly stopped cooling. Below is a timeline of the ensuing events:<br /><br />7/14/15: Called LG to set up a repair appointment.<br />7/16/15: An official LG technician came to our house and determined three different components that could be the cause of the issue. He informed us he would replace the most likely component, and if that didn’t fix it to call him to come out and replace the second component. We needed to give the fridge at least 24 hours to cool.<br />7/18/15: The fridge remained broken, so we called and made another appointment for the technician to return.<br />7/21/15: The technician came out to our house and repaired the next component. He informed us that if the fridge still wasn’t repaired, that the issue must be the compressor, and he would return to replace it. Again, we needed to give the fridge at least 24 hours to see if it would cool.<br />7/24/15: The fridge remained broken, so we called and made a third appointment for the technician to come out.<br />7/28/15: The technician returned to replace the compressor, noting that this repair would certainly solve our issue, but early in the repair process, he snapped a loop component in the fridge and stated that that particular component could not be repaired, effectively bricking our fridge in the process. He asked for our original purchase receipt, which we promptly provided, and said he would send it in to LG so that we would receive a reimbursement or a new fridge.<br /><br />Keep in mind that my wife had to take time off of work for all three of these repairs in addition to our being without a working refrigerator for two weeks (and still going strong). In the end, LG has offered to provide us with a store credit at the location where we originally purchased the fridge, but for the original purchase price, not including tax or delivery, which together total an additional $200 in our original purchase. As this refrigerator was bought for an amazing--and now unavailable--deal after several days of research and shopping, even purchasing the exact same model would result in an additional expense of $500 at least.<br /><br />I called LG's escalation center stating that I didn't want a store credit. I simply wanted them to send us either the identical fridge or the current model of it. It absolutely sickens me that they would send an official technician into my home, who would then effectively break my property, and expect me to have any out of pocket costs, let alone over $700. Bear in mind that customers are required to use LG repairmen, otherwise, the warranty is voided. When I asked the escalation center representative how he would feel if I came into his house, broke his property, and only paid him for a portion of what it would cost to replace it, he said, “But we paid you back for what you paid.” I said that I understood his viewpoint, but that an individual of his company destroyed my property and that an ethical solution should not cause any financial impact to me.<br /><br />Based on this customer service, I would never purchase any LG product again. I have worked in a similar industry and we would always either cover our customer's replacement costs in these situations or, ideally, provide them with a new, identical product at our expense. No one should ever incur any out of pocket costs when a corporation is at fault for destruction of property. Beware all LG products. Not only did this fridge last 16 months before needing repairs, thecompany that made it clearly doesn't value its customers or ethical business practices."

B004N4MSPO,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,Trust the positive reviews. This thing really is great. I've had mine for over a year now and it's still working great. If you start to have problems with dishes coming out still a little dirty I have the following experiences: 1) Don't try to use &#34;green&#34;/&#34;eco-friendly&#34; dish detergent. I tried both Seventh Generation and Trader Joe's powder detergent and they could never get the dishes clean compared toe Cascade etc. I'm not sure if the green formulations are just not effective for this dishwasher or they are generally ineffective but once I switched back to traditional powder detergent I had no problems. 2) Wipe the inside mesh base down with a wet towel. If you're like me and a little lazy and careless about rinsing your dishes before loading the dishwasher this will help remove anything blocking the drain.<br /><br />The only time I've had problems with this dishwasher it was resolved by doing either 1 or 2.

B00DYJNNWQ,"Luma Comfort IM200SS Portable Clear Ice Maker, 28-Pound",Major Appliances,4,"Great unit for the $$$... This thing just kicks out the ice... You do need to pay attention to it and empty as soon as the bucket is full as the continuous water will melt the ice somewhat.  It is smaller than I expected but it makes clear, nice ice.  We let it run and just empty the ice into a separate container in the freeze -- so, we have some ready at a moment's notice."
B00OTYK3O6,EasyGo Washer Mobile Hand Powered Washing Machine,Major Appliances,4,"I was looking for a simple way to clean small loads of clothes without wasting water, time and energy.  This unit seems to do the job very nicely.  I can do two loads in less than 15 minutes with no more than 2 gallons of water and a few drops of detergent.  The only issue I see is that the support frame is not very sturdy; it flexes and tends to 'walk&#34; even with the suction cups.  I will be constructing a more permanent frame.  The washer itself performs admirably; brisk enough for good cleaning and gentle enough to replace hand washing.  A wringer or spin dryer might be nice to have too though I just drape my clothes on the porch railing."

The first time it failed, it ran over and over again without stopping.  This time, it will not start. Called Maytag today to ask company to repair but they expect me to pay.

B004MX8XO6,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,1,"I got everything hooked up fine, and there were no obvious leaks when I turned on the water.<br /><br />However, shortly after starting the first cycle, it started beeping loudly and the overflow indicator came on. There was no water under the machine, and the water appeared to drain back into the sink.<br /><br />I couldn't get it to start up again, and eventually I tried to move the unit - as soon as I tilted it forwards, water came gushing out of the front left corner from under the machine - it's not leaking from the hoses or door, so the unit itself must have a bad seal.<br /><br />The manual is full of engrish and typos, and was extremely unhelpful, and the construction in general seems pretty shoddy - lots of parts don't seem to click quite right, the faucet adapter's O-ring is too thick for male connector faucets (yes, I took the second one out per the instructions) as it covers up almost all of the inner thread, etc.<br /><br />I realize there are lemons sometimes, but this seems to be a pretty common issue going by the reviews here - if not right away, than 2-6 months down the line. That's put me off even looking at a replacement. This was the cheapest countertop dishwasher on Amazon, and I guess you get what you pay for. Lesson learned."

B00KO90H6Y,Whynter Stainless Steel Cigar Cooler Humidor,Major Appliances,2,"Any review that says this works GOOD out of the box hasn't done any testing! At least in a similar environment as I am in. I live in the desert with evaporative cooling. That means good luck keeping your cigar under 70 F in the summer. I've measured Temp and Humidity on all shelves simultaneously even at the bottom with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable calibrated devices. Although when empty temp and humidity are more constant. The purpose of the device is to fill it up with cigars and create a micro climate suitable for storage of cigars. If the humidor is full there is little to no circulation of air. Temp differences of up to 10 degrees F and humidity up to 20% from top to bottom when humidor is full.  Humidor needs air circulation even if it is satisfied temperature wise. There are no allowances for this. When the thermo electric devices is activated (transferring heat) it acts as a dehumidifier. This product was made with out any thought. It's just a thermo electric wine cooler with cedar shelves. Guess what? Wine is in a sealed bottle (It's own micro climate) cigars are not!!! You are supposed to be creating a micro climate for the cigars. I am currently modifying mine with extra fans an a controller (AC Infinity AI-ATC, Fan Thermostat and Speed Controller with two sets of AI-MPF80A2 Quiet Dual 80mm). I hope this will work but I still have to overcome the lack of space (when full) around the shelves for air movement. I will update this post to let people know how the modification turns out.  Here is a list of some items I'm using to modify this product: [[ASIN:B00JWYXCKA Cigar Oasis Plus Electronic Cigar Humidifier]] [[ASIN:B00KGC1VBE Cigar Oasis Black WiFi Attachment Module]] [[ASIN:B00NG9TSG4 AC Infinity AI-ATC, Fan Thermostat and Speed Controller, for Home Theater AV Media Cabinet Cooling]] [[ASIN:B00IJ2J2K0 AC Infinity AI-MPF80A2 Quiet Dual 80mm USB Fan for Receiver DVR Playstation Xbox Computer Cabinet Cooling]] [[ASIN:B00B9234HE Spanish Cedar Cigar Tray]]"

B00O1BU6OO,"SAMSUNG NE58H9970WS Slide-In Induction Range, 30-Inch, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,"If you don't like to cook do not buy this stove. It's way too expensive to just be a decoration. If you do love to cook, this stove is for you. It heats on the stove top very quickly and evenly. The temperature control knobs for the range top are big and bold and there is an additional display on the stove top showing a digital display for each burner with a range of 1 - 9. Don't be afraid to put your cast iron skillets on the surface, just make sure you have the bottom cleaned very well and don't move them around while cooking. I cook home brew and this range has reduced my overall brew time by 30 minutes. The first time I brewed with this range I could hardly keep up, it is that fast. This is plain and simple a cooking workhorse. I continue to be amazed about the performance of this range every time I use it. I have used the convection oven for slow cooking and it seems to handle consistent temperature control pretty well. My wife will probably use the convection oven more than I do but she loves the option for dual-oven temperature control. There is a separation rack that allows dual oven operation and it has a very nice storage position in a slot directly above the warming drawer. The range top also extends over the counter on the sides which gives it a sleek professionally installed looked. Speaking of which, you will need a 240v range cord which is not included and professional installation is recommended. I installed it myself and my best advice is to check range top gap vs. counter top height constantly as you slide the range into position (you do not want to crack the range top). Best range/oven I have ever purchased and I would recommend it to anyone that loves to cook. I did attach part of the cautions included in the owners manual, they are pretty funny."

B00DNSO41M,Haier  Wine Cellar with Electronic Controls,Major Appliances,5,"I spent months, thinking about, shopping for, comparing, and trying to find a decent unit to keep those delicious reds safe from the warm California summers we've been having lately. The Bay Area where I live is usually cool, but these past couple of years have seen the temperatures higher than usual, and without air conditioning it can mean disaster for stored red wine.<br /><br />So many reviews are negative, about bad temperature management, damaged shipments, poor quality, etc. It's hard to find a good unit.<br /><br />Then I saw the Haier. I first learned about Haier while I was in China in 2003. A very common, quality brand that I found everywhere. They even sold indoor air conditioners that were standalone. I was impressed by them there, and when i saw that they made a cooled wine cellar, I immediately clicked to buy. Two days later, I have it.<br /><br />The packaging was superb, the unit arrived in flawless condition, and it took minutes to setup. Within 4 hours it it already at 52/56, perfect for my long-term and short-term storage bottles. Far faster than many of the units I read reviews about. It's quiet, not silent, but it's also in full-power mode as it brings down the temperature. I have it in the same &#34;noise zone&#34; where I can hear my kitchen fridge (a high-end Bosch unit, yeah, I know, they're all made by Whirlpool these days) so the whisper sound is a complete non-issue for me. It's in a corner, so the sound is slightly amplified, and it's all hardwoods so there is nothing to block the sound. And it's still whisper quiet.<br /><br />So far, it's excellent. Some Pinot Noir bottles are thick, to where they have to go in the middle slots, but I have enough standard diameter cabs to take up the four limited diameter slots. Very pleased with the purchase overall, and it is already stuffed - time to starting drinking more quickly!"

B0073M80UK,Whirlpool WRF560SEYM 19.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"We purchased a Whirlpool refrigerator, Model WRF560SEYM01, Serial #VS40591338 from Home Depot (Store 6364 W ST PETERBURG, 2070 TYRONE BLVD N, SAINT PETERSBURG, FL) on 07/04/2014, we did not take delivery until October 2014.<br /><br />The refrigerator was setup for delivery on September 20, 2014.  We made a trip from Melbourne, FL to St Petersburg the night before to accept delivery.  I called Home Depot at 7:30 am on September 20, 2014 to get an approximate time of delivery and at that time was informed that the refrigerator was on back order and could not get a date.  If I had not called we would have waited all day.  And we made a special three hour trip to be here after work at 10:30 pm the night before delivery!<br /><br />It was finally delivered over two weeks later.<br /><br />The two deliverymen did not take the packing out of the refrigerator and told us to leave the protective plastic wrap on the refrigerator, we had to call Home Depot to have someone else come out and do these things.<br /><br />On October 18, 2014 I called to get the water filter fixed, the filter popped out of the housing every time the water dispenser was used or the ice maker cycled.<br />The work was completed November 5, 2014.<br /><br />On 06/15/2015 we had to call because the refrigerator was making a very loud grinding noise.  At this time I had to fax a copy of my receipt, along with the model and serial number of my refrigerator.  At this time I learned that my refrigerator had been previously sold by Lowes.  This refrigerator had been previously sold to someone else!<br />Service was set up, and a part was ordered (Thermistor W10383615) and work was completed on 06/23/2015: ($274.70 in lost food and medicines.)<br /><br />The same problem occurred on 07/14/2015.  We were now out of the Whirlpool warrantee and had to schedule through our extended warrantee with Home Depot.  Service was set up and the serviceman came on 07/16/2015 and had to order a part.<br /><br />On 07/25/2015 the refrigerator shut-down due to ice build-up.  The serviceman told us this is the fourth of this model that he has worked on the same malfunction. The part was not replaced until 0727/2015; again we have sustained a loss of food and medicine. ($333.00 in lost food and medicine.)<br /><br />The serviceman requested that we let the refrigerator defrost naturally by leaving the doors open, which we did overnight.  When we turned the unit back on this morning (07/28/2015), the water filter leaked profusely when the water dispenser was used or the ice maker cycled.  I thought it might have been the filter.  I bought a new filter, installed it and it still leaked. Now I am out $50 for a filter I didn’t need.  We put in a request for a service on the filter unit, which was replaced when the refrigerator was brand new.  I am sure the service man will come on Thursday 07/30/1015 and will have to order a part and it will be another week that we will have to put up with a refrigerator that is not functioning proper.<br /><br />July 30, 2015<br />The serviceman was scheduled between 8:00-12:00 in the morning; he arrived at 2:00 pm because of his work load.  Not his fault and I really appreciate his service.  (He also told me this refrigerator is a “piece of junk”).  Both the water-line into and the water-line out of the filter were broken and mold was found inside the water filter casing (pointed out to me by the serviceman).  This serviceman had not previously touched the filter or unit. ( It had probably been broken by the person that serviced it in October of 2014.)  Oh, and he did have to order parts; so we are now without water or ice for at least a week?  Will I be reimbursed for the water and ice I have to purchase?<br /><br />July 30, 2015<br />After the serviceman left, I called the Home Depot Service Plan Hotline and they told me to take my complaint to the “Store Level”.  That will be my next step in this procedure.<br /><br />July 30, 2015<br />Two hours after the serviceman was here, we found a buildup of ice under the vegetable drawer.  The person I spoke to at the Home Depot Service Plan Hotline told me that I could not file a new service call because the previous one had not been closed yet.  This person was very curt and rude."

Good thing I called I thought it was damaged when postal delivery threw over fence.  But after call I was emailed info etc I like this product

I purchased it not for wine cooling, but for my essential oil collection.  I have it in my laundry room, and it is a little too deep for my shelf, but I knew that before purchasing.  It is supposed to cool down to 50 degrees, but it stays at around 53 degrees."

Our dishwasher is less than a year old.  It started malfunctioning about 3 months ago (it would suddenly stop in the middle of a cycle).  We have had numerous technician visits so far and the technicians have in turn installed various replacement parts.  However, the dishwasher is still not working !  KitchenAid customer service keeps insisting on sending out further technicians and postponing giving us a replacement.  This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a dishwasher that costs over  $1000 !  I would STRONGLY recommend against buying any Kitchenaid dishwasher.  The quality control is truly atrocious."

B0084IY1ZU,Samsung 4.2 cu. ft. High-Efficiency Top-Load Washer - White,Major Appliances,1,"I agree with all of these reviews.  The machine is a total mess.  I went through the flood and now I am dealing with an 3E error.  The washers fills up with water to the very top and then just sits there.  If your turn it off it drains the water and fills it up again, this time without any soap.  And again it just sits there not doing anything.  A&E replaced the motor for $157 service charge.  That didn't fix it.  The next thing on their list to fix is the control board.  I'm not spending $394 for the board.  I will just buy another washing machine.  I can see now why Samsung wants you to pay $600 for a 5 year warranty.  They would probably lose money even at that amazing high price.  How can a company build such a bad product and not make an offer to help with the replacement parts.  I am used to washing machines lasting 10 to 20 years, with no repairs.  Samsung is making washing machines that last one to two years.  These things are not printers!!!  A Best Buy salesman recommended Samsung.  I had no idea how bad Samsung appliances were.  I will never buy another product from them and I will never shop at Best Buy again.  When I told the Best Buy manager of my issue, and all he could tell me was you should have bought the warranty.  Nope, I will buy a washer that don't need a warranty.  If anyone wants to join me I would love to start a class action lawsuit.  Samsung should not be allowed to sell something so bad and not pay a price."
B00KY5V4M4,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine with Spin Dryer,Major Appliances,1,The machine is a piece of crap in comparison to other portable washing machines out there. I returned it and bought the haier and I am much happier. The machine leaked and the hoses are a joke.
B004MX8XO6,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"We've had this for 2 years now, sitting on our counter right next to the sink.  This little thing is fabulous!  Our dinner plates *barely* fit in it, but they do.  It connects easily to the sink, runs well/quietly, and let's you know when it's done.  (It'll also give you a reminder beep if you pause it and forget to restart it).  It cleans well... there's not much more I can say.<br /><br />When we first set it up, there were a few small leaks, but some shifting around and tightening of hoses fixed the issue, which hasn't returned since those first few weeks."
B00V52TLCA,"Midea WHD-127FSS1 Compact Reversible Double Door Refrigerator and Freezer, 3.5 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,I was apprehensive about buying this at first for 2 reasons.I was unfamiliar with the brand name and there were no reviews here for this product.But i took a chance because the price was low and my old fridge was on it's way out.Firstly let me say the shipping was very fast.I used free domestic shipping and it arrived three days after i purchased it.The freezer works great.I have yet to need to put anything in there but there's plenty of space.Got cold very fast after turning it on.I did notice slight frost build up on the back of the fridge and in the freezer but nothing major.Just turn the thermostat down a little to keep it to a minimum.My only complaint is that the fridge part isn't as spacious as i had hoped.I ended up removing the drawer and the bottom shelf so i could fit gallons of milk in there.Other than that it works fine.I'll update if i run into any problems.
B0083H1INK,NewAir 126-Can Beverage Cooler,Major Appliances,5,"I'm so excited to finally have gotten this!  I was looking at first for a small refrigerator to keep drinks cold, but this beverage cooler was by far a better choice because it allows so much more space for drinks.  The shelves are adjustable allowing for different sized drinks and I love the glass front.  I've only had it a couple days and it's running very smoothly.  It made a little noise when I first plugged it in, but I don't notice any noise from it now.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it."

B004Q0CQA2,Frigidaire 8-Bottle Capacity Black Wine Cooler LFWC08T5LB,Major Appliances,2,"I bought the Frigidaire 8-bottle capacity black wine cooler at Lowe's.  I was initially impressed by how well it kept the temperature at the exact setting, compared to other units I've seen that have a 2-3 degree variance.  However, within a year, this unit lost the ability to hold the temperature that I set it for (54 degrees) and now cannot hold a temperature below 58 or 59 degrees.  It has also become much nosier than it was when new.  My opinion has changed greatly in the span of 1 year.  If you are wanting a cheap wine cooler, this is it.  If you want a quality wine cooler that can hold a set temperature, you might want to invest in a better unit."
B0057WCGJ4,"Bosch 800 Series SHX68T55UC Fully Integrated Built-in Dishwasher 24"" in Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,"After its predecessor put in over 10 years of hard work it decided enough was enough. Because of the quality I'd seen in this dishwasher I set out in search of another Bosch (I ended up getting it from a local store) and I wasn't disappointed. There are clear improvements over my old dishwasher. For one this is even quieter than the old one was. If you don't know how to tell how quiet things are when listed in dbA there are some great charts online if you search. (FYI 44 dbA is very quiet, especially for a typically noisy appliance). If you have a noisy dishwasher now the attached image will give you an idea of how much of a change this is - that red light on the floor is there to tell you the dishwasher is running a cycle so you don't open it.<br /><br />The 3rd rack for utensils is very useful. It's an excellent place to stash those spatulas and other items, including extra flatware, making it great for multi-course dinners (or people like me who mess up way more than they should). It does take away a little real estate from the 2nd rack, but that one is adjustable so it is not a big deal. Have some extra-tall items in the bottom rack? Adjust it upward. Need more room in the second rack for tallish glassware? Adjust it downward. (see image) Another nice thing (and so many dishwashers don't seem to have it, I don't know why) is enough flatware compartments for you to sort as you load so you can grab like items easily to unload later. Between this and the 3rd shelf you can forget your sorting flatware and utensil headaches. One thing my previous Bosch had that I wish this one had is the easily convertible racks. You could easily angle and flatten various bits of the racks to accommodate your needs at the time. This one has parts that do that, but others that don't. Not a big deal though.<br /><br />Cleaning is also substantially improved over my old Bosch, which was a vast improvement over the 'dishwashers of yore' that involved washing the dishes before washing thedishes (or having a dog or two on call to 'pre-rinse'). The first job I had for my new dishwasher was a truly nasty one too. I had agreed to let someone come over and use my smoker for a pile of ribs before I discovered my previous dishwasher was dead (my smoker is the variety that allows you to shove all the internal bits into a dishwasher). Like anyone who has had a good dishwasher for a very long time my own washing skills are sorely lacking so all the 'smoker bits' were left to swelter. What I expected to be a day or two turned into several days of hot hot sun baking that stuff into the racks too. NASTY! The new dishwasher not only removed all that gunk, but restored the parts to an almost pristine condition (allowing for typical wear and tear). Awesome. I gave it a disgusting task right off the bat and it breezed right through.<br /><br />Next job was to re-wash all the things I had hand-washed earlier (did I mention my wonderful dishwashing skills?) just in case. Plus all the flatware because let's face it.. after a few days who knows which ones were my shoddy work vs. previously Bosched. Those I did on a short cycle because in theory they were clean (or they would have been if someone with better skills had washed them, I'm sure). Easy breezy. Spotlessly clean and now sanitized dishes ready to go back to their places.<br /><br />After a few days of eating take-out when I discovered how long it would be until I had another dishwasher (and how bad I was at washing dishes) I cooked a lovely dinner, so there is load #3. Filthy rotisserie bits, greasy pans and lots of dishes. This time on a normal cycle using the delay so it runs in the middle of the night. I love waking up to clean dishes I didn't have to wash, don't you?<br /><br />Overall this is a great dishwasher and well worth the cost. My old Bosch actually cost more in its day so the price is even more reasonable. It met expectations and even exceeded them in the nasty smoker bits category. Welcome to thefamily new Bosch... you and I are going to get along just fine!"

B000Y8SRCQ,"Zephyr AK2100AB Power 30"" Black Under Cabinet Range Hood",Major Appliances,3,"I installed one of these about 6 years ago.  It is pretty powerful and provided good service until about a year ago.  About  a year ago we started having issues with the switch, (aka it stopped working)  to their credit zephyr sent another one @ NC. It cost $200 to install and worked &#34;ok&#34;<br />A few days ago the left fan motor bearing  gave up, overheated and screeched to a halt.  I figure that 6 years use with the original cost of ~~ $600 plus $200 repair this cost about $130/year.  I don't know that compares to other brands at other prices.  We are locked in to buying another due to vent locations,....etc.  Could be worse, .............could be better.. for what it's worth Zephyr service was fairly decent."
B0037AE45C,LG : WM3431HS All-In-One Washer and Dryer TITANIUM,Major Appliances,1,"Pros - it is space saving, is gentle on clothes (more gentle than TL models with agitator) and looks nice<br /><br />Cons.  Really Badly designed.  Gasket in front gets moldy because the water builds up in the channels and there is no drain.  Even with wiping it out after every wash, leaving the door open to air out, running sanitize cycles and using powdered soap and no fabric softener (and running sanitize cycles with bleach or vinegar), I still get mold and then my clothes smell like mold.  Very high maintenance to prevent the mold and not really worth the time considering how expensive this is.<br /><br />In order to clean out the lint and buildup, you have to practically take the machine apart.  Mine is in a built in custom kitchen and it is a nightmare to do this.  All other part that might need a regular service are also similarly inaccessible so , in addition to the high cost of purchase, there is a very high cost of maintenance.<br /><br />I had combo HE front loaders in europe and never had to do more than a moment's maintenance and never had issues.  This one is more trouble  than it is worth.<br /><br />Drying time is LONG.  Like for lightweight summer sundresses and underwear and not even a full load 1.5-2 hrs long.  When I can hang my clothes outside I  can just about bear this thing, but when I can't, I curse it's existence with all my heart.<br /><br />It came with the house I bought, but I would never buy anything like this again.  I dislike it sufficiently that I am considering removing it to get back some of my cabinet space and going to the launderette."

Ambient room temp. steady at 74F. entire time.  So finally gave up and emailed AKDY customer support and received refund within two days after providing proof of purchase and photo of temp. setting.  Very polite, respectful communications. They didn't ask me to return the cooler, so trashed it.<br />Had to remove one shelf to fit some larger bottles.

B00KVMEFMQ,"SPT SD-2202S Countertop Dishwasher with Delay Start, Silver",Major Appliances,5,"The fact that I place the dishwasher far from sink just to reserve food prep area does the magic of hiding excess length of hoses too. The distance from machine to sink faucet is just matches with hoses' length. So I don't see hoses here and there.<br />My height clearance is exactly 17.25&#34;. And the unit is 17.24&#34;. Making it look semi build-in. This issue took me 2 days to make solid decision and place order.<br />I believe SPT, Edge Star, Danby, and many other brands use same manufacture. There is no way each brand makes same dimensions, specs, features, and interiors. Therefore, I opt SPT based on its simple exterior design and reasonable price, since I think each brand will perform the same anyway.<br />I ran the machine twice today (first day). Came out sparking clean and hot.  No water spots (I use<br />Cascade Gel with Clorox. And Jet Dry rinse aid)<br />Washing cycle is a little longer than what it says on manual. Running pretty quietly, except when waste water come out into sink (sound like fully opened running water out of faucet into stainless sink), but no complaint tho we don't have room for a built-in.<br />Surely it has heat drying (many users are not sure about this)<br />Installation took me 5 mins.

B00HZRJVCO,"Electric Small Mini Portable Compact Washer Washing Machine 110V, 9LB Capacity",Major Appliances,3,"We had gotten this because the coin operated machines in our apartment were getting super expensive.<br />There are a couple things you should know before you buy;<br />1.) This works on gravity. Basically the source of the water needs to be higher than the top of the machine to use the hose because it won't fit over the sink faucet, and the drainage needs to be lower than the base of the machine so it will drain properly. I currently have to use a bucket. and it is causing back pain for any large amounts of cloths needing to be washed.<br />2.) You will have to wring out EVERY SINGLE ITEM. After doing 2 baskets of laundry in one day, my hands are raw.<br />3.) If your items are super dirty you may just want to rinse them in the sink instead, it surprisingly uses less water but I use the machine to soap them.<br />If you are not okay with any of these things then I suggest you look elsewhere.<br /><br />Over all this item is Okay at best.

B00CM6IXCC,Bosch SHE68T55UC 800 Series 24&quot; Wide Built-in Dishwasher with 16 Place Setting Capacity Touch Control Technology Load Size Sensor Ultraquiet 44 dBA Delay Start Sanitize Option in Stainless,Major Appliances,1,"This unit smells like garbage. It stinks the whole house. It also does not dry dishes. And is only so-so at cleaning. Definitely not as good as the 10yr old whirlpool it replaced. The problem with this dishwasher is the door comes unlatched during mid cycle. It stinks up the house due to old stagnant water laying in unit. Problem is it pops open 10 times every cycle. It takes a couple of days to get a load completed. So I researched a little and found that Bosch has had problem with door latches for over 5 years! You can place one finger on the door and it pops open. Bosch sent a repairman out. He said they see this all the time. In fact he was leaving my house to go report another unit. He said Bosch answer is to replace the door latch, but barely does that fix the problem. He said he could remove the trim pieces on the side of machine that prevent you from looking between  unit and cabinets. He removed them and unit worked perfectly during the two weeks waiting on part (there is a huge demand for these parts). Serviceman came back installed the new latch and asked if I wanted him to install the trim strips. The machine is noticeably louder with the strips removed. I told hime to re-install them. Unit is almost the same as before. Now the door only opens 4 or 5 times a cycle, instead of 8 or 10. The trim strips I spoke about install between the door and the frame. They are too stiff and put pressure on the door. It amazes me that they have had this problem for 5 years<br />Bosch also told me that the unit was not installed correctly and if that was the case I would have to pay for service call. From reading the other review, this is a typical Bosch tactic. Blame everything on the installer.  I asked what could be wrong with the install to cause this but they could not answer. I will have them service this unit one more time. If it is not fixed, I will demand a refund. When they refuse, I will go to local courthouse and file a small claim. I may win or I may not win, but at least I will get the satisfaction of them having to pay a lawyer $200/hr to come and defend this in court. I have done this a couple of times before and the company (different companies) always relents. It is cheaper than paying a lawyer. Even if they don't you are only out $20.<br />It is a shame that the service person knows how to correct the problem, but Bosch won't listen to him. What a stupid arrogant company. Just read the number of bad review. 37% of people who purchase gave this a one star."

It would fit under a desk but I have mine on a small table in a spare bedroom.<br /><br />It has plenty of space inside, in fact I just use it to keep supplements, face creams, some cosmetics, medicines & bottles of various preparations to keep them cool.  It would hold quite a few cans or bottles, sandwiches etc.<br /><br />In an office environment, the quiet sound it makes when cooling would in my opinion not be at all disruptive, even whilst on the telephone or conference call.<br /><br />It's style,  with stainless steel door is smart without being in any way obtrusive,& since mine is upstairs, I find it a very convenient way to keep products away from the refrigerators I use for food.  Excellent quality for the price."

Never hear it working. Holds close to the advertised number of bottles (I have several different sizes). All in all, I am pleased, and the price was right."

Yes, it cost more, and it really doesn't matter what my newer brand is, but at least it has a solid feel, cooks better, and has a self clean function, and can tell you what the internal temp is. You can also slide the oven racks easily, which was impossible with the Verona. The display on my new one is way more user friendly and intuitive. If you never cook and just want a commercial looking range, then the Verona is fine. But if you even want to boil water, I'd pick another brand"

Capacity Stainless Steel Drum Delay Start Antimicrobial Seal Automatic Water Level Control and Energy Star Rated in,Major Appliances,1,"Update: This washer made my clothes small like mold. I had to add additives, the crystals. plus boosters to my darks so my clothes didnt smell moldy. Then a year after purchase, the washer began to not drain, kept water in cycle, twice, then stopped working altogether. After having a repairmen come out because THERE IS NO WARRANTY PEOPLE!!!!!!!! (30 DAYS BUT SERIOUSLY FOR $1500 WORTH OF PRODUCT!)<br />and the repairman said that this was typical of Frigidaire (mental note never to buy again!)<br /><br />So my review is that if you are reading this, or any ad to purchase on Amazon, they contract out these sales and the warranty depends on the company and if this is a 1 Stop product, no warranty. The fact that the washer broke down after a year says a lot!<br />In July, I ordered a new washer and dryer online.I would never have thought of ordering online, but as I did my research, the pricing to purchase through home care was so much better than Lowe's or home depot. I got my order in a little less than a week too!"

B00AVD4F52,Kingsbottle 120 Bottle Compressor Dual Zone Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,3,"After extensive online search, we purchased the Kings Bottle (KB) 120 wine cooler to replace a 50 bottle Magic Chef unit that died. We would not purchase the KB again. The cooler looks very nice. The cooler is heavy! The delivery man could not get it in the house by himself. The temp display is on all the time and glows brightly at night in a dark room. The cooler holds nowhere near 120 bottles and even less if you have anything other than the skinniest of Bordeaux style bottles in your collection. We had to pull out a couple of shelves to make room for some large format and non-conventional bottles, like Turley or sparking wine. Eighty bottles is a realistic capacity for this cooler. Unless you want to sacrifice even more capacity, the bottles have to be placed on shelves parallel to the front of the cooler. If you pull out a shelf that is less than full, the bottles roll and clink crazily. Also, the lip at the back of the shelf is not adequate. If you aren’t careful, a bottle will roll right over the back and fall down to the next shelf. The shelves are not adjustable. The only way to increase clearance between two shelves is to remove a shelf. The unit had a very strong chemical odor, initially. Be prepared to air it out or load it with boxes of baking soda. While there are two temperature zones, the lower zone has to be set at least 4 degrees higher that the upper zone. I don’t think the Kings Bottle 120 was designed by a wine drinker."

I painstakingly reviewed all the options and this is the one I settled on.  I was lucky to find it locally.  I live on a houseboat and things get tippy in high winds.  This unit has literally toppled over on its side numerous times over the two years because I have it on a custom made &#34;dolly&#34; and it takes a licking and keeps on ticking (I really should just strap it in place, I'm too lazy).  My clothes come out clean even though I always wash in cold water and the water extraction is good enough to hang dry the rest of the way. With a dehumidifier running in the same room even jeans are usually dry overnight.  It has snagged clothes on just a couple of occasions but any damage done is far outweighed by the convenience of having this machine rather than having to go to a laundry mat.  I love my Danby and highly recommend it."

The packaging was impressive and it took 2 people more than 15 minutes to unwrapped the box. The freezer appears to be cold enough and I'm testing the time to make ice cubes.  The bottom level took several hours to feel cold so I would say that this is not a fridge good for raw meats unless you're putting them in the freezer. It is good for storage of drinks, sauces, vegetables and any overage from your primary fridge. The motor runs very quiet. For any fridge that is under $500 with this capacity, I would rate this as good value.  Just hope that it doesn't break after the one year warranty."

B0125S2K0M,"Avalon Top Loading Water Cooler Dispenser - Hot & Cold Water, Child Safety Lock, Innovative Slim Design, Holds 3 or 5 Gallon Bottles - UL/Energy Star Approved",Major Appliances,5,"[[VIDEOID:d54cfc2fdc8774ce61fcbbaa64ce7dc6]]I've had a water dispenser for many years and totally love it.  I'm quite experienced with what I want and don't want in a cooler.  I call them water coolers because their commonly known as around the office.  There are several things to note about them, but nothing particularly earthshaking or cautionary.  They are intuitive to work and very handy to have around.<br /><br />The Avalon came very well-packed, but because it has refrigerant it shouldn't be carried or laid on its side.  I had no problem pulling it up a few short steps by the plastic straps.  Don't remove them until you're in the approximate area you wish to set up the dispenser.  Once they are removed, the dispenser will be rather awkward to move.  I say this from experience because I did this on another large item and had a lot of problems moving it.<br /><br />It was easy to get it out of the box once I started.  I clipped the straps and then took a box cutter and slit one side.  The cardboard fell away and left me with the dispenser sitting on a Styrofoam base (there was one on the top as well).  After the removal of a few pieces of tape I was good to go.  If you're in a high traffic area or want to make sure it doesn't tip, there's a bracket that can be screwed into the floor (included).<br /><br />The best idea is to let the Avalon rest for at least a 24-hour period to let the refrigerant settle.  There are two switches on the reverse side that are clearly marked.  Make sure they are both on before starting.  If you aren't going to use the hot water for some time, simply keep it in the \\""Off\\"" position so it will enter a power-saving mode.  There's no storage area in this particular dispenser, something my other one had.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't go the cheap route, buy one bottle of water, and refill it from the tap.  These dispensers can really suffer from mineral deposit buildup that impact the performance of the machine.  I had my dispenser for years and use Primo water and never have had an issue.  It will take both the three and five gallon bottles.  The Avalon is a bit tall so I stood on a bench to install the bottle.  A full five gallon bottle is quite heavy and should be done by someone capable of lifting and balancing the weight.<br /><br />After I had everything set up, it didn't take very long for the Avalon to heat the water on one side and cool on the other.  I do love the fact that I only need to push the taps to get a cup of water.  With my other one I had to press a button and catch the stream of water below.  There's a great safety feature on the hot tap.  I do need to press the red button on the front as well as the tap.  This will prevent anyone getting scalded accidentally when getting some cold.  FYI, if you have children under the age of eight, I'd give this one a pass.<br /><br />The cold dispenser doesn't dispense ice cold water, but it is cold.  The hot dispenser is quite hot.  I tested it by putting a little packet of Swiss Miss in a mug and dispensed some hot.  The cocoa totally dissolved sans that hideous clumping I hate.  It was nice and hot, but not boiling.  There were no extremes in temperature, but that wasn't something I wanted nor expected.  One last hint is not to set it up in where the sun will hit it because my other one yellowed in time.  All in all, I do love the Avalon and would highly recommend it to someone who wants a sleek, efficient water dispenser.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.ever have had an issue.

B0009XH6KK,Cuisinart CWC-900 Private Reserve 11-Bottle Stainless-Steel Countertop Wine Cellar,Major Appliances,1,"I did not buy this on Amazon, however I have the exact same wine fridge and it is AWFUL! I have had it for 7 years (it was a wedding gift), however I have only been using it for about 5. It has always been in a temperature controlled room, and rarely moved other than for cleaning. For awhile now (not sure how long, but I caught it a few months ago...) it has not been able to cool at all, being stuck at 77 degrees. I contacted Cuisinart's customer service, and because it is more than 3 years old, they will not do anything about it. I have had to re-explain myself to many different customer service reps from Cuisinart, as my emails have been handed over from person to person. I have a lot of Cuisinart products and have never had such a horrible experience. I can't believe they don't guarantee their products for longer than 3 years, and I can't believe they are unwilling to do anything to help. They would not offer any suggestions as to how I could try fixing it, only telling me they would be willing to sell me a new one. I am so very disappointed. Stay away from this product!"

B00E5Y5PWU,KOBE Range Hoods Brillia Under Cabinet Range Hood 680 CFM Stainless Steel with LED Lights,Major Appliances,2,"The unit came with a small dent on the front right side where you can see it. See photo. I would have given it a one star, but my wife didn’t notice it after the installation, so I gave it two stars. It wasn’t enough damage compared to the hassle of returning something that weighs over fifty pounds. The outside of the box didn’t have any visible damage, so I didn’t find the damage until I took everything apart.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Looks good.<br />2. Good suction. I didn’t find the fan noise much different than other hoods.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. No installation instructions in the box. I found lousy installation instructions on their website. Their website has a place for a video, but there is no video.<br /><br />2. One of the fans didn’t work on low. Then it worked on high, but made a noise. Found out it was rubbing the plastic cover. I had to use a longer sheet metal screw to fix it. It’s possible I warped it holding it up during installation, because I thought I tested everything before installation. Be careful not to touch the covers when trying to hold it up.<br /><br />3. You have to drill holes for installation in preset locations (mentioned by others too), but the locations don’t give you enough tolerance. I had one screw almost on my front cabinet. Other manufacturers making units one sixth the price have a slot where you put up screws and slide the unit on them. I had to use nuts and bolts, so I have holes in the inside of my upper cabinet. One person had to hold the unit up while another put in the bolts. The manufacturer should have several pre-drilled spots with the wider holes to slide on to screws to easily solve this.<br /><br />3. There’s a metal box near one of the screw locations making it difficult to work with with almost no room for your hand.<br /><br />4. I have no idea why they have handles on the upper grease screens. It’s a waste of time to install them and they are not necessary. You should have a magnetic screwdriver to put on the handles.<br /><br />5. The spacers above are painted and do not match the brushed stainless of the other parts. Unless you are short you would not see this or care.he handles.<br /><br />5.

It worked for for another 2 years, and now won't cool again.  This time, there is no error message. A repairman came by and it is either a problem with the compressor, or a leak of coolant resulting in compressor failure.<br />There are very few licensed LG repair professionals, so out of pocket costs to repair can be costly--for us--it is in the $500 range now that we are out of warranty.<br /><br />This product was also part of the LG class action lawsuit (for the IF error).  However, you would have had to file your claim within a certain period to be a participant within the lawsuit, and it only covers certain things.<br /><br />LG does have poor customer service.<br /><br />This model has many other problems -- ice maker frequently jams when you use the &#34;crushed&#34; ice setting.  The stainless steel front easily gets dinged, so if you have kids be careful."

B00O06XCIM,Frigidaire 242294502 Refrigerator Water Filter Bypass,Major Appliances,4,"The filter in our refrigerator needed frequent (frequent to me at least, 3-4 times a year) replacement, or the flow of water would slow to a trickle.  By itself that would be annoying, but it also would result in the water line freezing in the freezer door and ice production slowing to a crawl.  I got tired of replacing the filter every few months (they're pretty expensive) and got the bypass instead.  It works as its supposed to: it allows water to flow through the system without any filtering.  Our water quality is fine, so we don't really need a filter.  I think it's a little absurd to have to spend $30 or more for this &#34;feature,&#34; but what can you do.  At least now we don't have to spend that much several times a year every year to replace filters."

My favorite appliance of all time!  So easy to clean, so fast and responsive (like gas in that way) and so much more control than gas and safer.  (I can turn pasta water (after a full boil) to 5. and walk away with the lid on knowing it won't boil over because the heat is so exact.  I never burn rice because I can turn to an exact number knowing it's perfect....so much control)  I also feel really comfortable leaving a pot of soup or whatever on all day, even if I leave the house (no worries about a flame or gas leak and if for some reason the pot did spill over it automatically turns off).  The ease of clean up is just so wonderful - one wipe with a washcloth and it looks like the day you bought it.  Also, you can even do things like put paper towels between the pot and the stovetop while cooking to help with messes.  Use the timer feature and also the rapid boil feature almost daily.  Wonderful technology, love love love it!"

B00DJF6296,Midea Washer All Sizes,Major Appliances,1,"Arrived badly dented with a thrashed box, tried to get replacement parts at first, then return, but seller ignored, then wouldn't help us, like the other reviewers are saying. Stuck with a $300 machine that was dented upon arrival. We decided to try to set it up even though the big dents made it super ugly, since we were now being forced to keep it, and it is a total pain to set up. It is clearly made with cheap materials. It is also not &#34;portable&#34; as claimed in the description. The two little wheels on it make it *slightly* easier to put in its home but I would not say you can pull this thing out and put it away on a daily basis. It's almost the same size as a regular washer and just as heavy! Water leaked out of it on the first test run. I'm wondering if this machine is part of the defective batches someone else is talking about? Because we bought the machine right around the same time as that other reviewer. Needless to say, I will never buy another Midea product again, and especially not from the unhelpful seller."

B00CXNC5XM,KitchenAid KFIV29PCMS Architect II 28.6 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE ON THIS GREAT LOOKING PIECE OF JUNK.  I know what you're thinking...&#34;Yes, there are bad reviews on this refrigerator, but I can't base my purchasing decision on that because most people who write reviews about appliances aren't happy with their purchase and those that are happy just don't bother to review.&#34;  I thought the same thing and made a very regrettable decision that has caused me a significant amount of time, money and aggravation.  Take the time to read as many reviews as you can and you will see problems that are common to almost all reviews.  You will find in other reviews the same problems I describe here.  The first four months were bliss. And then it started.  First, it was ice buildup in freezer. Then frost/ice built up on the evap coil located behind the wide deli drawer inside the refrigerator (yes there are two evaporators on this model).  The refrigerator stopped cooling although the wide deli drawer remained cold).  First service visit diagnosed a bad evap and ordered a new one along with a new compressor (&#34;because the life of the compressor has likely been shortened due to the bad evap&#34;). Second service visit was to install the evap and compressor - or so I thought.  This tech said we didn't need a compressor, just a new evap. Once he got into the unit he said only the evap fan was bad and that we needed a new fan, not a new evap. He ordered the fan because of course he didn't have one in his truck (&#34;we don't carry parts&#34; ). Third service visit - replaced fan, still no good, now need a control board replacement.  Installed board and checked the loud freezer fan which had ice buildup on it causing it to be loud.  24+ hours later, the unit is now quieter, but the refrigerator is holding steady at 54 degrees which is well over 15 degrees too warm!!  It has been over two weeks of living without a refrigerator.  We've been buying ice nightly for the ice chest that keeps a few essential items from spoiling.Whirlpool customer service is basically non-existent - it is merely an answering service.  HANDS DOWN THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ALL TIME.  That's saying a lot because I have Charter Communications cable TV!!  Don't but this refrigerator and find yourself writing a scathing review a few months down the road.  I wish I had heeded the warnings. If this site would allow it, I would rate this model AND Whirlpool customer service with FIVE NEGATIVE STARS."

B00VLX20YY,Kalamera 28 Bottle Stainless Steel Freestanding Wine Refrigerator,Major Appliances,4,"I bought the previous model of the Kalamera 28 Bottle wine cooler and then purchased this updated version to sit beside it and provide more wine storage.  The newer version has a stainless steel door and wooden shelves in contrast to a black door and steel wire shelves, but other wise looks identical.  The electronic controls at the top of the door offer the same functionality.  My only issue with the new model is that larger diameter bottles do not fit as easily and contact the shelf above, compared to the steel wire shelves, which are contoured to allow the bottles to sit a tad lower.  The older model allows bottles to be removed without pulling out the shelf, but the new one doesn't have enough clearance to do this, so you must pull the shelf out to access a normal sized bottle.  When the wooden drawers are weighted down with 4 bottles, there is something on the rear of the shelf that catches and one must use lift the rear of the shelf slightly to get it to pull out.  I'm happy with both models, and I assume the newer one will have the same great functional characteristics that the original model had.  When comparing these smaller wine coolers to their higher capacity cousins, they seem like a much better bang-for-the-buck."
B00KJ07SEM,GE MWF SmartWater Compatible Water Filter Cartridge - Refrigerator,Major Appliances,5,"I received my filter and followed the instructions for installation.

B002ZD6MJS,GE Stove / Oven / Range Bake Element WB44X5019,Major Appliances,5,"I am so lucky to have a Hotpoint oven from the early 60s, which lets me simply plug in my baking and broiling elements. No really, I just plug it in like a power cord. I was all set up for a nightmare of cutting the power and pulling wires out of the wall to somehow remove the old element and attach to the new one while being super careful not to let the wires slip back behind the oven (which would force me to remove the whole oven from the wall), but that is how NEW ovens work. I have an OLD oven, so it took me all of 30 seconds to unplug the burnt out element and plug in the new one. I am never getting rid of this oven if I can help it. I also bought a second element for future use since GE and Sears have stopped carrying them."
B00NN1CF0G,"LG LFXS30726S French Door Refrigerator, 30.0 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,3,"I love this fridge: Capacity is awesome! Ease of use is fantastic. It's quiet. The dispenser seems a bit backwards from what we were used to, but it's still good. I don't like how the decals for the ice and water are already coming off - not truly decals - they are printed on the product. I DO NOT appreciate the fact that we purchased this last October and had it replaced with the same model in March due to an internal frost issue. The inside back of the refrigerator behind the drawers and trays had an excessive amount of frost accumulate on it. Replacement product has been great until recently, when the same thing started to happen. Apparently LG knows about this issue and has re-worked the control board on the back side of the fridge that controls the defrost mechanism. Hopefully this will fix the issue...unless I have it replaced with the newer model, but apparently those boards are all bad as well. If you know about an issue, do a recall and service the items before customers have to go through the hassle of having to deal with them. Get on board with quality customer service, LG! On another note, be prepared to take the excess ice out of the ice-maker frequently - we have a container in the freezer for the excess ice. The ice maker bin is small, so it doesn't hold much and the shut off valve is non-existent in these models - a huge design flaw, but definitely not worth not owning this huge capacity refrigerator. I still love it, but am super frustrated with the repairs!"

This machine is made for idiots. And only idiots would say nice things about it. My wonderful new Whirlpool washer just got a new motor (W10677715) and actuator (W10006355). Called for service 6-29-2015 Repaired on 7-21-2015. Just called again for the same problem. Now I feel like an idiot for ever buying this Made in the USA appliance.&#34;<br /><br />I'm sure Whirlpool could make a quality, user friendly washer if the Government would let them. And the Green People need to stay out of the appliance business. I can't believe these new washers save much energy. Remember the Suds Saver washers of long ago? They reused the hot soapy water for additional loads. Now that's energy conservation.."

The tech adviser at Broan admitted that's it's a problem with their design - that it doesn't do well with water vapor.  Not worth the money."

You know, the ones that you have to keep the manual handy to use. Forget that. This is a well made, simple, ordinary microwave. The only thing I would change is giving it a door handle instead of a push-button door opener, That being said, I will not dock stars for this because I certainly knew what I was purchasing when I got it and the door button works fine. I have read other reviews saying that in order to push the button, the microwave tends to slide (mostly on the 1.1 cu.ft model) but that is not the case with the 1.4 cu.ft. model. It stays in position fine and the button is easy to push. Also, it runs very quietly and the beeps at the end are not brain-cringing."

B009AK62U8,"Broan QML30SS Under-Cabinet Range Hood, 30-Inch 200 CFM, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,"Clean lines, modern... and affordable! Looks great in our kitchen; so glad we ditched the over-the-stove microwave. The under-hood lights are bright (bulbs not included) and are easily toggled via the switch on the front. The two fan-speed options are also nice, though, I'm not sure how effective they really are, as we're not using it ducted to the outside. On the high setting, it certainly draws up steam during a boil. I was slightly skeptical of the build quality during installation because it seemed a little flimsy. Fortunately, that was not the case, as once squared-up and bolted in place, this thing is solid -- no flexing.<br /><br />Here are the Broan filters that go with this hood: [[ASIN:B007Z1KJT4 Broan BPQTF Non-Ducted Charcoal Replacement Filter for QT20000 Range Hoods]]<br /><br />As an aside, I had to order this unit three times before I finally received one that was not damaged. This was a QC issue on Broan's end, as these come double-boxed: the hood inside a factory box, then that box inside another from Amazon. Both hoods that I had to return had clearly been dented at the factory as all boxes were pristine. I'm not going to ding the product itself for a factory mishap unrelated to its performance, but I wanted to just put it out there since it was an issue."

B00IBHK400,Deflect-o Dryer duct Cleaning Brush Kit DVBRUSH12K/6,Major Appliances,3,"This Cleaning kit did not work as well as I had hoped, fibers from the brush got stuck in the sections where my vent ducting connect, mine is a straight run about 28ft, so you have to clean from both sides.  Fortunately I was able to push it forward while spinning my drill to free it up after a few min.  I was afraid the rods would break during the process as they were too flexible for my application being a straight run.  It would have been a mess if the brush was stuck 12 feet in since it was jammed good, even my fiber pull rods wouldn't be able to clear that out.  Not all of the material came out and some of the derbies was really stubborn although I will say for shorter dryer duct runs this tool would be good.  For bends and longer runs be very careful or you could have a bad situation.  You can't just reverse the drill to unjam or you risk un-threading the rod sections.  I would like the rods to have some locking mechanism once they connect for this reason and to have an option for firmer rods for straight runs, even with just two sections the rods bend considerably, I was worried the whole time the section were going to break so I worked very slow and cautiously.  On a bright note it does get a lot of lint out of your ducts.  The construction could be better."

B005FD7Z82,"The Laundry POD, White",Major Appliances,3,"This is good for small things, such as shirts or even thin cardigans. I can fit about 3-4 items of clothing in it, usually. (Example, 2 tshirts and one long skirt).<br /><br />There are other similar products that are half the price and I am not convinced this one is worth the extra money. The feature that this has that the other cheaper products has is that it allows you to spin some of the water out of the clothes, so you don't have to wring quite as much  and they don't drip as much when you hang them to dry.<br /><br />However, the product is pretty cheaply made. I'm okay with the bucket just being a giant, cheap, plastic bucket (over sized salad spinner). Salad spinners for salad are usually pretty expensive, after all. But there is always black pieces coming out from where the handle comes out of the top. It's not a huge deal because it doesn't get into the clothes, but they are very hard to wipe away because of their location, and if you don't wipe them away the handle squeaks a ton while spinning.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm happy with this purchase. It definitely does get the clothes clean and it's nice to have an alternative to going to the laundromat for small loads.<br /><br />Here's my process for using it:<br />1. Fill up the tub a little over half way with water (so far I've only used cold) and put in a drop of soap. Mix the soap and water with my hand.<br />2. Move the bucket out of the tub onto a stool next to it, so that when I drain later, gravity will help.<br />3. Put in my clothes and let soak for a few minutes to an hour (whenever I remember to come back).<br />4. Turn on Pandora and spin (changing direction randomly) for the duration of one song (2-3 minutes)<br />5. Let drain. This takes a few minutes.<br />6. Fill it up again with cold water. Spin for another 2-3 minute song.<br />7. Let drain.<br />8. Once it's drained, leave valve open, hold onto the pod (it's much lighter without water in it, so flies all over the place if you're not careful), and spin for another minute.<br />9. Hang to dry completely in a room with tile floor and a fan. How wet the clothes still are after you spin depends on the fabric and how full the load is. Sometimes it still drips, but not always."

B005GM942C,Panda Small Mini Counter Top Portable Compact Washer Washing Machine 5.5-10lbs,Major Appliances,2,"I would have rated this five stars, because I have owned one of these before, and it lasted me five years, so went to replace it. The company has &#34;revamped&#34; the product with a different agitator at the bottom. The original agitator had three large, thick, inch tall rotors on it, (you can see it in one of the photos) was outstanding and torqued the water magnificently and I could put four big towels in it no problem. The new agitator is not good. (you can also see this in another of the photos. Both rotors are shown in different photos.) The newer agitator has four small rotors, with bumpy things between them. This four small rotor agitator does not torque the water as well as the three rotor agitator. The bumps between the rotors prevent the water from getting between the rotors and spinning with a large torque. Not to mention the rotors themselves are very small and don't push the water. I sent it back, because putting only two of the same towels in it caused it to stop rotating much at all. I hope the company puts the old rotor back in it....you know the saying...if it ain't broke don't fix it...and it wasn't broke before! This newer model is not good...sorry"

B00F4NR43Y,KingMas Digital Cooking Food Probe Meat Thermometer Kitchen BBQ,Major Appliances,5,Came in a small container and I liked it because I can keep it semi clean when I keep them in my kitchen drawers. The thermometer is pretty easy to use have 4 buttons with labels and for such a great price I'd recommend giving this one a try if you are looking for a decent meat thermometer without breaking the bank.  pros: easy to use         carrying case          cons: it is battery powered and I am assuming the battery that it came with will last a while but it is one of those small round batteries. Which most people don't keep around much.

B00SNKU7VQ,Whirlpool W10295370A Compatible Water Filter - Refrigerator,Major Appliances,5,Worked great and just plugged and in and worked.  Ran 4 or 5 glasses of water through it and it was clear and drinkable.  I'll definitely buy again at this super price point.
B00HY3619A,Igloo MIS1530 Freestanding Beverage Center and Wine Cellar Fridge,Major Appliances,2,"Even after reading the poor reviews for this product, I bought it anyway.  I don't think that was a terrible decision, but I wish I had been a bit smarter about things.  Once it arrived, we let it sit overnight and then plugged it in.  The temperature only went down to 40, but I knew that when I purchased it.  The temperature is a bummer because nothing is really cold, but once again, I knew that when I bought it.  It didn't make any loud noises or any annoying buzzes so I thought we were lucky and got a good one.  So since everything was working, I threw the box away.  THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE!!  Absolutely hold onto the box for 90 days until you cannot return it to Walmart anymore.  Also inspect it like crazy within the first 90 days.  About a month ago, I noticed that the door was not sealing properly and so the refrigerator was having trouble keeping things cold.  The stuff at the front was cool and the stuff at the back was frozen (it had to run all of the time to maintain the 40 degrees because the cold air was leaking out the unsealed front door).  But I couldn't return it to Walmart because I had stupidly thrown out the box.  I called the manufacturer since there is a one year warranty.  The warranty is a JOKE!.  I need to mail the refrigerator to Michigan.  That costs almost as much as buying a new one.  How stupid!<br /><br />So, despite all the customer service problems,  we ordered another one.  This one seems fine.  The door seals, everything is evenly cold, and it does seem to keep things colder than the other one.  I'm keeping the box this time and will regularly check it up until the 90 days since the warranty is such a joke.<br /><br />The reasons why I was willing to buy another one are these: 1) the price, 2) the wine rack, and 3) it has glass shelves.  The other low cost beverage coolers have wire shelves which annoy me."
B00CDWTQKI,"The Laundry Alternative Nina Soft Spin Dryer, Ventless Portable Electric Dryer. 3 Year Warranty, 127V, 60 Hz",Major Appliances,5,"LOVE the new Nina Soft Spin Dryer &  Wonder Wash combo!<br /><br />We live in a fifth wheel and have an on-board washer and dryer. Sometimes it takes the tumble dryer up to 4 HOURS to dry two bath towels even though they'd been through the spin cycle in the washer.  Since we don't always have full hook-ups and some park laundry facilities are up to $3.25 to wash and dry a load, I'm now using Laundry Alternative's Wonder Wash and the Nina Soft Spin Dryer.  The Nina Soft pulled nearly 3 quarts of water out of EACH of two towels, after which the tumble dryer finished drying both in 40 minutes.  Woohoo!<br /><br />Other remarkable drying times:  Nina Soft followed by the tumble dryer = Queen sheets dry in 20 minutes; 4 pair of jeans shorts, 20 minutes.  Nina Soft + line dry on a hot day = 20-30 minutes total drying time for T-Shirts /Shorts.  Pretty amazing.<br /><br />The spin dryer's earned a permanent place in my RV kitchen because I use it almost every day.  I'll still be using it even when I have full hook-ups and can return to using my regular washer.<br /><br />I dealt directly with Laundry Alternative and they were great to work with... answered many questions by phone and email before and after receiving my products.  My only regret is that I didn't order them a year ago.  I could have saved so much time drying my clothes, and money at  park laundry rooms.<br /><br />RVrs:  The Laundry Alternative people told me it's BEST THAT NINA SOFT TRAVELS UPRIGHT v. stowed on its side.<br /><br />BOONDOCKERS, I asked the Laundry Alternative people how much water would the Wonder Wash be putting into the grey tank for washing and rinsing?  Here is their reply:<br /><br />&#34;It takes a little over a gallon of water to wash the clothes. Rinsing depends on the method used. If you refill the machine to rinse, you can use up to 3 gallons of water&#34; [total, wash + rinse water]. &#34;You can also rinse by hand, and perhaps use less water. The best way to use the least amount of water is to use a spin dryer...it's not commonly known, but a fast spin cycle removes a great deal of detergent suds...most people assume you must use water to rinse, but fast spin speed also does a great job of rinsing.&#34;<br /><br />For what it's worth, I'm making my own low suds powdered detergent from recipes found on youtube, and I'm getting great results with only 1/2 - 1 TEASPOON of powder per load in the Wonder Wash.  Makes rinsing easy and the water extracted via the spin dryer is coming out nearly clear.  If you have to be super conservative with water while boondocking or managing your grey tank level, it is easy to recapture the rinse water from the Wonder Wash and the Nina Soft and re-use it to wash the next load.<br /><br />The photo compares the Nina Spin Soft to my counter height and a one-step folding stool.  Hopefully it will give you a good visual comparison for size.  Believe me it's worth the space.  And the price for the Laundry Alternative combo.<br /><br />BTW, my husband was fussing that these were just &#34;gadgets&#34; before I made the purchase.  After watching me keep the laundry clean this last month and my neighbor schlepping off to the laundromat with 3 weeks dirty laundry, I got a welcome, &#34;Good decision, Babe.&#34;  Can't beat that.  Unless he did the laundry.  LOL<br /><br />UPDATE 10/20/15:  STILL LOVE THE WONDER WASH/NINA SOFT SPIN DRYER COMBO<br /><br />Have only had full hook-ups about 2 weeks out of the last 4 months, but the laundry situation isn't a hassle any more.  The combo works - clean clothes in less time.  Was able to use my regular washer this week, but only used it for 3 big loads.  Found I prefer the Wonder Wash for small loads of like things, plus the quick turn-around time of just a few minutes to wash and rinse a load.  Used the spin dryer after each of the regular washer loads, too, and it was remarkable how much soapy water was extracted.

B004HXDOZO,Whynter BWR-33SD 33 Bottle Built-In Wine Refrigerator,Major Appliances,1,"There are many problems with this unit. We bought ours from Home Depot as part of a kitchen renovation. It is very loud, disturbing other activities in an open concept floor plan. Something is always running, hardly ever stops. Probably the fan, compressor. It broke within the first 9 months. Customer service is non existing. We were asked to ship the unit to and from CA, our expense. No local dealer could be found to even have a look at the unit. One told us, repair would be at least $300 for small repairs, a new compressor would be far more. What a headache it has been! We have to buy a new wine cooler, another big expense for us. By the way, the whynter unit costs $447.35 at HD on 7/2915. But please don't buy. It's a piece of junk and there is no help from the company to make wrong things right."

The motor and all seems fine, but if you can't use the keypad it's useless. The model we bought isn't made any more - this one is supposedly an improvement. I can't say, but we have no faith in Samsung microwaves at all. Getting it fixed of course isn't worth it since it will probably just fail the same way. The worst thing is that Samsung is aware of this fundamental problem and didn't recall them. And Consumer Reports shows Samsung has a 3x higher repair rate than other brands like Whirlpool and Maytag. Buyer beware."

B00N1XAVFC,NewAir CC-100 250 Count Cigar Cooler,Major Appliances,3,"Like most, I searched and searched for the best type of humidor to get (desktop, etc.) and settled on this one. Reason being, our Florida weather makes it difficult to fully control temperature in regular humidors short of keeping your thermostat at 70 all day...and that isn't going to happen. While I'm away, it is kept at 83'ish, so that is not a good scenario for cigars. So this unit became my choice so I could eliminate temp variables. Now, the good:<br />1) Nice looking unit...a bit deeper than I envisioned, but not a problem and holds plenty of cigars for someone not trying to show off with hundreds of them. I have maybe 50 in there, but will add more at some point.<br />2) Very quiet<br />3) Nice display...the LED light inside doesn't really do much with the drawer and shelves in though. You can see it, but it doesn't light it up like I know I would like.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Like I've seen in other reviews, the temp is NOT accurate. I've put 3 thermometers (digital hygrometer with temp., a maverick remote temp probe, and another) and they are ALWAYS reading 4-5 degrees higher than the unit display. This might be a problem if it is not properly controlling temperature as advertised.<br />2) I don't know if it's a learning curve or not, but I cannot get consistent humidity readings in different areas inside. I properly seasoned it and even kept it empty for over 4 days to get that right. The hygrometer that comes with it will read 62, the digital one will read 71, and another analogue one will read 80 (they have all been salt method calibrated!). So I ordered the Boveda 75 calibration pack and re-did all of them (minus the built in one). Same result...no consistent reading when placing them in multiple areas inside the unit. I'm using the Xikar crystal gel humidifiers (250 count) with PG solution. I started with the container and distilled water to season it, added in 1 Xikar with PG and let it sit for a few days. Once I saw a 66-70 humidity reading on thedigital, I put some sticks in. A day later I put the rest in. Expecting a slight drop in humidity from adding the sticks, I waited another day. Now the humidity was too high. I removed the container and left the 1 Xikar. Another day or so goes by...now it's too low. So I added another Xikar...now goes too high....@#$%^&*!!! Remove 1, and finally the digital goes to about 69. BUT...the other hygrometer on another shelf is reading....76...WTF???<br /><br />So, I'm not sure what to do with this unit at this point. I'll keep trying to balance it for awhile, but if I can't get it right, and that coupled with the temp inaccuracy, it will go back. I don't want to return it as it is a nice piece, but I need it to work. I may try the battery operated air freshener fan (without the freshener in it of course) to see if more air movement will equalize things."
B0017Y3GGI,"NewAir AI-100R 28-Pound Portable Icemaker, Red",Major Appliances,4,"After delivery, I allowed the unit to sit undisturbed on a countertop overnight per instructions.  The next morning I filled the water tank and turned it on.  While I did not put a timer on it, I'd estimate that the first ice was produced in 15-minutes and then more added every 10-minutes thereafter.  The machine makes what I call ice \\""bullets\\"" in that they are bullet shaped, and hollow point at that.  We have noted the ice is soft, not hard cubes like your refrigerator makes, and does not last as long in an iced drink. But as a means to create emergency ice in the middle of a gathering, it's great. We bought to use on our RV, will update as we have more experience with the units ability to stand up to camping stress.<br />Update: have used almost a year on our motorhome. The unit performs well and can fill an ice bucket in a couple hours under right conditions. By \\"" right conditions\\"", the unit needs to be situated indoors, preferably in air conditioning. Using it outdoors on a warm/hot day significantly impacts production and retention of ice."

Not sure why some reviews called them flimsy.  It's a sheet of silicone pressed out to meet specifications for gaps between the countertop and stove.

B001SH7BAG,Danby DWC518BLS 5.1 Cu. Ft. 51-Bottle Silhouette Wine Cellar - Black/Stainless,Major Appliances,1,"The fridge is pretty average, but temperature was hard to control and maintain. I had a bad experience with Danby customer service. The glass on the door of this fridge shattered one night. Nothing hit it, so its still a mystery as to why it shattered. The fridge was a couple months short of the warranty ending, so I contacted Danby customer service to get a new door for my unit. After sending in all the paperwork requested, I didn't hear from them for 2 weeks. I contacted them, and after being on hold for about 30 minutes was told that there was&#34;no way&#34; that the glass could have shattered on its own and therefore they would not cover the cost of getting a new door. I think its ridiculous when you pay a lot of money for a company to not uphold the warranty. I was not asking for a new unit, just the door. when I asked about purchasing the door, they said they don't sell it since it is hard to ship without breaking. Just think twice before you purchase any of their products. For an average fridge, I'm sure another brand would do just fine."

You are to push a button to remove the container. Ours has not worked from Day One. It seems to be frozen. We cannot remove the container. We had it about a week, when the ice maker leaked water on the floor. Guy said a part was defective. We waited about three weeks for the part, turned the ice maker off. Ice maker now works, but puts out a combination if cubes and crushed, regardless of setting. We like the fridge, but we expect a fix on the ice maker, or replace the entire unit. Also, do not replace the filter. Just remove it, and you can save yurself some money."

B008RL4OCY,"NewAir AI-215SS Portable Ice Maker,Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,"The first one came and I let it sit overnight.  Went through the vinegar cleaning and rinsing, that's one of the reason I chose this maker, the cleaning cycle.  No ice, the finger never even got cold to the touch. Packed up and sent back.  Can't happen twice, can it? Yup.  I went through the same pains with the second one. Rest it, clean it, rinse it, fill it...No Ice. Well, OK, I did get ice. Exactly 1/2 a cube.  Only the first finger of it got cold.  Empty it, dry it and pack it up.  Third time's the charm, right?  I'll let you know.  I hope my UPS driver doesn't hate me, this thing's not light.   Success!  The 3rd time IS the charm!  This beauty makes ice FAST.  I walk in the door and hit the power button.  Before I can get my shoes off, change clothes and let the dog out it's already working on its second batch of cubes.  The holding compartment isn't temperature controlled but it is insulated enough that a full bin lasts until morning so I can fill my mug for the day.  It was a pain in the bum to send 2 of them back but, with free returns that wasn't a problem.  I would recommend this to a friend.  P.S.  The UPS driver still speaks to me!  He figures it keeps him employed ;-)"

B00F2E62AG,Samsung DW80F600 Top Control Dishwasher with Stainless Steel Tub,Major Appliances,1,"I bought this new in anticipation of a kitchen remodel. The renovation took longer than expected so when installed, it was already out of the 1 year warranty and not working from the moment it was installed. Samsung was THRILLED to hear that they weren't responsible for it anymore. So much so, they even refuse to offer any guidance or advice. A dishwasher with reviews this bad certainly has a good history of service calls and, I would imagine, lengthy service bulletins. But Samsung won't share. Its a nice looking, brand  new, non-functional cupboard in the new kitchen for now."
B00K31ADMQ,"Samsung Appliance White Front Load Laundry Pair with WF42H5200AW 27"" Washer and DV42H5200EW 27"" Electric Dryer",Major Appliances,4,"We bought ours from a local big-box - and saved quite a bit as they were on sale. But with regard to the product most people go here to buy - so here is where I'll review.<br /><br />When the units are stacked - as they are at my house - you cannot read the dial on the dryer if you're even near average height (I'm 5'5&#34;, my husband is 6' and he's just able to see it).  they do require a lot more space than we anticipated ... so be sure you measure twice before you buy. in addition to the extra space, leave about 6-8&#34; for the dryer vent tube ... it takes up a lot of space too.<br /><br />We really like the product though - we've run several wash & dry loads and have had no issues. I hope they hold up for the long-term!"
B00KA4CIW4,"Samsung DW80H9970US Chef Collection 24"" Stainless Steel Fully Integrated Dishwasher - Energy Star",Major Appliances,2,"Is it possible to hate an appliance?<br /><br />I bought this product from another provider.  The first unit I had delivered leaked and it took over a month to get Samsung to agree to look at the machine to find out what was wrong.  They finally found a dent and hole in the tub... they claimed it was damaged during delivery, but the location of the hole makes that impossible... it had to be damaged at the factory, before it was packaged, as the package was in perfect condition upon delivery.  Regardless, they replaced the unit... but it took a month!<br /><br />I've had this unit since September of 2014.  There are two pros to the unit, which is the reason I've given it two stars... it is VERY quiet, and it cleans very, very well.  Beyond that, it's a huge disappointment.  I always use the Sanitize function, so with heated drying, it takes 3 hours and 16 minutes minimum to complete a cycle.  Loading the unit is always a challenge... the tines that hold the dishes in the lower rack are very small and flimsy, and they constantly collapse every time I try to load the dishes.  They never hold our plates upright, limiting the number of dishes we can load.  The upper (3rd) rack just didn't work for us... we took it out after the first week, as it only prevented us from placing tall glasses in the top rack.  If you lower the top (2nd) rack to wash taller glasses, there's not enough space in the lower rack for our plates.  The baskets for the silverware are small and are lidded with flip-up covers with slots for the silverware.  Most of our silverware drops through the holes in the tops of the lids, which is fine.  But if you have to open one of the covers to wash larger items, use caution as the covers strike the side of the dishwasher block the rack from closing properly.  You can break the cover, or the rack will twist sideways when you attempt to slide it into the unit.<br /><br />Many have complained that the latch on the door doesn't work properly... in fact, the problem is that the top rack does not go all of the way in unless you're very careful and push only from the center of the rack.  If it doesn't snap in place, the door won't close completely, and the dishwasher will sound an error.  Likewise, if any item in the lower rack hits the door, you're likely to have a problem.  After finally working through this issue, we've not had any problems with incomplete cycles.<br /><br />I'm fortunate... I have a very large kitchen and we have two built-in dishwashers as we entertain frequently.  My other unit is a top of the line KitchenAid.  I no longer use the Samsung... my partner uses it.  If I hadn't paid so much for this thing, I would gladly rip it out and chuck it in the garbage.  I would not recommend it to anyone."

Less than 3 years old and I've had to call (and pay for) service on both the washer and dryer.  We splurged on this set when we moved into a new house, and I regret it.  I had a basic no name washer and dryer for 15 years and never had a service call.  On the washer, if you don't make sure all coins and other things are out of the pockets, it will break the washer (I have teenagers so it's almost impossible to guarantee everything is out of the pockets).  They dryer's heating element isn't working now, and I have a repair person coming out to fix.  I don't run a laundry business with these machines, I wash clothes about once a week for a family of four.  Keep looking for a better set."

B004HXDOZO,Whynter BWR-33SD 33 Bottle Built-In Wine Refrigerator,Major Appliances,4,"I have had this wine fridge for about 6 months now and like it so far. It says it fits 33 bottles of wine but if you put that many in it they cannot all face the same direction. I wish the interior light was brighter but I don't use it often so it's not a deal breaker. Other reviews have mentioned the hum sound of the motor. The hum sound isn't super loud but if it's quiet in your kitchen you will hear it. It doesn't bother me at all and I don't even notice it anymore. The circulation fan cycles on and off frequently to keep the temperature even throughout the fridge, so that's usually what I hear, not the actual cooling motor. This fridge is meant to be a built-in or under cabinet, although you could use it freestanding if you wanted.<br /><br />I have received lots of compliments on this wine fridge and would purchase again."

I've ALWAYS had that dripping water from the ice maker in the refridge from day 1 (it's annoying).  I had a repairman out to fix this and the Evaportator Fan/Motor were replaced ($350) and ice was removed.  Less than Four weeks later and I have the same problem.  This refrigerator is seriously flawed and defective.  Anyone want to see about a Class Action Lawsuit ?  It seems everyone has the same problems happening.

It's effective, easy to use and is decent-looking -- important, because it's a prominent part of my decor in this small place!

B00JFJMWTE,Bosch B22CT80SNS 800 21.8 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator,Major Appliances,4,"So far we are pretty happy with this fridge but there's a few things to be aware of:<br />- The shelves have little in the way of adjustment options, up or down and that's it. None of the shelves slide out or fold up, this is a nice feature in much cheaper brands and models.<br />- No butter bin!<br />- The very top of the fridge tends to freeze whatever is up there, in our case that would be our eggs. This happens when our fridge is set at 38 degrees even, which happens to be the recommended and preset temp from the manufacturer.<br />- The produce drawers are very shallow, this is a trade off for having a water dispenser in the fridge, the reservoir (keeps the water cold) sits behind the drawers. I'd say you lose a good 4&#34; of drawer depth from the reservoir... but the water dispenser is pretty awesome (more on that later).<br />- Has adjustable feet instead of adjustable rollers, that means when you adjust the feet it lifts the rollers off the ground. Pain in the butt if you need to pull the fridge out for some reason, not like you need to do this often but still a minus none the less.<br />- Lighting is not the best we had seen in our search for a fridge, All the other brands had lights all around to eliminate shadows and dead spots. This has two lights at the top which are blocked easily by eggs or pizza boxes.<br />- The left door is a bit harder to close than the right one since the door spacer is on that side. Which is a pain since the water dispenser is on that same side. If you open both doors at the same time it's not an issue. Wish the spacer was on the right side.<br /><br />Okay on to the things that I love about this fridge:<br />- It holds magnets! Love putting our kids artwork on the fridge and our GE profile fridge didn't allow for that.<br />- From the time we plugged in it was cooling groceries in 4 hours. This thing keeps food COLD, notably our lunch meat which has an extra three days of life (8 days total) over our last fridge.<br />- Ice! This thing cranks out ice like I've never seen before. 18 hours after I plugged it in we had a full bin of ice. It breezed through our last dinner party where most were drinking mixers. Love the ice maker, which btw comes with a built-in scoop holder and scoop and with the flip of lever it attaches to the door so it slides out upon opening.<br />- Water dispenser rocks. We used to buy bottled water since our tap water tastes so gross, not anymore. Water comes out cold and it tastes like deerpark water.<br />- It's a beautiful fridge and it fits like a glove in our cabinet cut-out.<br />- All the drawers open and close smoothly, including the freezer drawer and inner storage.<br /><br />If you add up it up appears that the negatives outweigh the positives but I don't think so. We went into this knowing that every fridge we considered would have it's drawbacks. I only found one negative review in my countless hours of research and that is worth peace of mind to me. It seemed that for every good review I found of another brand there was an equal amount of negative reviews. We are a family of four with a 5 and a 2 year old and it's plenty of space for us at the moment, we do have another fridge in the basement that holds a decent amount of frozen goods though. No regrets here I would buy this fridge again for sure.<br /><br /> As a side note this is the same fridge as the kitchen aid architect II series and another jen airr model. Tried finding the differences between them but I could not."

A couple weeks later, same problem. A new repair person was requested. He no called and no showed, after I had taken a vacation day to meet him at my home. After more effort get him to my house, the problem was found to be a faulty valve in the closed system, covered by warranty fortunately. Several months later, the problem is back. KitchenAid customer service is extremely difficult to work with. I have had at least 5 service calls on the refrigerator since buying it. In my opinion, the KitchenAid brand has been brought down considerably to the point I no longer consider it a premium brand. Steer clear of this and other KitchenAid appliances."

B00EQ7MKHO,Samsung DW80F800 Top Control Dishwasher with Stainless Steel Tub,Major Appliances,1,"THIS IS IN REFERENCE TO SAMSUNG QUALITY IN GENERAL, not this particular model:  The following text was almost posted on the BBB complaint website:  &#34;Purchased Samsung DMT400RHS dishwasher in July 2011.  Water level sensor has failed and been replaced twice at our expense, the first time within weeks of warranty expiration.  These failures stopped the machine in its tracks.  Now within the past month, detergent dispenser door opening mechanism (possible wax motor issue) has failed; we have checked carefully to ensure that nothing is blocking the door from opening.  A viable, albeit inconvenient, alternative allowing continued use of this machine without additional repair cost would be to add detergent manually at the end of the Prewash1 cycle.  To do this we need to know exactly how long that cycle is.  Spent 45 minutes on hold, talked to 3 different people/departments at Samsung, was unable to obtain that number, which had to have been programmed into the machine--someone has to have it!  Finally we were given a number which shunted us to Sears, completely away from Samsung.  Sears believably maintains they cannot get this information on a 4-year-old machine.  All we need is a simple 1- or 2 digit-number, and we have been stonewalled by this monolithic corporate giant whose strategy for customer &#34;service&#34; is apparently to give customers the runaround until they give up.&#34;<br />Update:  Called Customer Service again, after 40 minutes of aggressively insisting on not being transferred away from a supervisor, learned that Prewash 1 cycle is variable, dependent on water pressure and temperature of water provided by household water heater.  There is no progress light illumination which corresponds to Prewash1/Wash transition, so it's down to intelligent guesswork, which is not satisfactory.  After $1,300 in purchase and repair expense in less than 4 years, we are going to have to replace with a non-Samsung product."

Okay, to make a long story short; when he open the package he was so happily surprised, because this cooler is the one he researched as the &#34;best cooler&#34;. Needless to say, he was very  happy. I was happy too ,because I did'nt want to return it. The cooler looks great with a interior light that you can turn off or kepp on. the size is wonderful and everything is cold to drink."

B00NN166DS,GE GFE28HSHSS 27.7 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,WARNING: do not ever buy a GE refrigerator! We have owned ours for 2 months and it's already broken! I had to wait for an hour on hold to be told they could t come out for 6 days!?!? It took them 6 days to fix it and I lost all the food I had in it!! About $1000 worth between fridge and freezer! When they were asked what I should do about the loss they gave me a phone number which will only send u a $100 voucher no matter how much or little you lost! When I wanted a complaint with GE they transferred me to another line where I waited on hold for 4 hours to be told they were then closed! I will never own another GE appliance and we will be replacing both ovens/ the range/ dishwasher/ and washer dryer set ASAP so as to be with a company who stands behind their product!

I tried working with it for quite a little bit hoping that maybe I could get it to work for me. But operator error, my bad.  A quick call to Amazon and they got me in touch with Avanti who helped me resolve the problem and it works beautifully. So glad that I did not need to return or exchange it at all. Would recommend it to anyone! Runs very quietly and chills my wines to the right temperature. Being able to store opened bottles upright is the greatest feature."

All of the bad reviews are correct. Wish I would have read them first.  Bought the machine and in the first week it broke, the second week the service tech couldn't fix it, the forth week they replaced it.<br />They replaced it with more junk.  I have had 3 other breakdowns one took over a month to be fixed. Not to mention that I had to take 4 half days off work to wait on the clowns that came to repair it.  Well it just broke down again and I've about had enough.  Stay away from Samsung appliances, their products are beautiful on the outside and cheaply built junk on the inside... remember, beauty is only skin deep!"

It does not have any timers or buttons - you plug it in and it spins; you unplug it to shut it off.  I am line drying baby diapers and the diapers were taking a long time to dry.  Now, I put the diapers through this device before hanging them up and they dry in an hour or two, the same as any other item.  This device gets a lot of extra water out that the spin cycle on my washer does not."
B00DNSO2UK,Haier  Wine Cellar with Electronic Controls,Major Appliances,5,"Amazon has scored again.  We received ourHaier unit and as the driver set it down, it sounded like a rain stick, with lots of lovely tinkling sounds.  Not good if you are a wine cooler.  Notified Amazon and it was quickly replaced, different carrier, and received in perfect condition.  Unit maintains even temp, and looks quite nice.  We have this unit in our bedroom to accommodate the space requirements on the sides and rear of the unit.  I was concerned about some of the complaints about noise, but we have only noticed a quiet hum, which is not loud enough to disturb our sleep."

Very quiet & smooth operating.  Last night got over 2 cups of water out of a small load that had been put through the spin cycle on delicate in the washer, but just a few drops out of a towel & sheet that had been spin dried on the fast setting. Great for people who do hand laundry or use machines without a good, fast spin dry.  I usually use a wringer after hand washing most stuff & get a lot of water out, even after wringing twice.  Cuts line drying by 2-3 hrs.  I have probably used the Nina Soft 30-40 times & continue to be impressed. Need to make one in camo & call it the Ninja soft for us guys, though."

The weight of this unit made install (alone) a breeze.  I was also pleased with how much I was able to stock in the unit; significantly more than my old one which is the same size.  You basically can't even hear this unit running, so that is nice.  Lastly, after two weeks of using the unit daily, I have found that the temperature is very even within.  Really no complaints here!"

However, after several weekends of cold coffee I caved and went looking for a small microwave that would look cute on the kitchen counter without taking up too much space. I AM SO FREAKING HAPPY WITH THIS. It's literally the most adorable microwave that you could ever want. If you do &#34;cooking&#34; with a microwave, then this isn't your best option. But if you're looking for something to heat up a beverage or reheat something small then this guy is great for you. Have I mentioned how cute it is?!"

B002ZWR194,NewAir AW-121E 12-Bottle Thermoelectric Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,4,"When my previous New Air AW Space Saver 18 stopped working after a little over 4 years, I decided to purchase another one.  I liked the style and it fit perfectly on my countertop.  The new one works perfectly and is extremely quiet.  It states you can store 18 bottles, but I found that to be quite difficult.  The better wine bottles are slightly larger, but by removing a few of the racks, I can store as many as 12 bottles, which works for me.  The other criticism I have is this.  When I unpacked the item, it was missing the two screws needed to secure the handle.  Luckily, I still had the old one waiting to be put out with the garbage, and I used the two screws from that to secure the new handle. If I didn't have the old one, this would have caused a major issue.  Also, there were no set of instructions or warranty booklet, which I found to be strange.  I feel their quality control division needs to improve."

We had this 40 days and on the 37 day the freezer got up to 47 degrees and the frig side 54 degrees. However from day one it is the loudest refrigerator, it sound like gun shots going off in my kitchen. (its not the ice dropping).  After spending this much money we DO NOT want this in our home. we are in the middle of litigation to get our refund back. Why would anyone want to spend this amount of money just for it to take a dump in 37 days. We do not want repair men coming to our house every six months.  Samsung actually hung up on us after being transferred to a supervisor twice. They will not help as they want someone to take a look at it first. It is no wonder Amazon does not carry these refrigerators anymore. I do not blame them."

Stainless Steel Counter Depth Side-By-Side Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,"I purchased this model (Rsg257aars) fridge in 2012 as well as the matching dishwasher. My biggest complaint is the shelves are cracking.  3 of 4 interior shelves have multiple cracks and 2 of 4 DOOR shelves are also broken/cracked. This is with standard use - no damaging incident to produce such effects.  I'm hoping the HHGregg extended warranty will cover to replace them!! I'm kicking myself for spending $2100 (plus $250 warranty plus delivery $70) on this low grade appliance.  And the dishwasher had an issue after about a year where it wouldn't drain and had an error code on the front display - ended up replacing EVERY part over 4 technician visits so it finally works now. For how long, who knows???"

This filter arrived several weeks back and I have not been impressed.  When first installing I ran several gallons of water through the lines and discarded it. The water tastes funny, almost like tap water. Maybe this isn't properly filtering the water.  I will be returning this item and getting another GE filter."

We needed a small microwave to install in our pantry and this fit the bill. It holds a 12&#34; plate and has multiple power levels for cooking, but we use it mostly for rewarming. It does take about twice as long as our old microwave but that's okay. One feature I really like is the one-touch button for speed cooking.

I bought this machine in September 2012 and since then, despite that fact that I maintain it as outlined in the manual, we have had to have LG send out repair techs on at least six occasions. Today I came home to see yet another drain error, and at this point I am going to be throwing out and replacing the machine.<br /><br />While the day to day function of this machine is adequate, it breaks down so regularly that it's not even worth having a washer/dryer. LG's customer service is awful, refusing to replace a $1500 machine that breaks down at a rate of twice a year. It's unacceptable. Spare yourself the time and aggravation and look elsewhere for a washer/dryer. This one will suck away your time and money."

Mine has been a pain since arrival!!! The freezer drawer squeaks really loud when opening. It does not glide smoothly and jerks side to side. The inner basket gets stuck preventing access to your food. They fixed it twice and it still does it. I have lost a lot of food, chicken and fish go bad within a couple days. When you open or shut the french doors, the freezer drawer seal burps open, so to speak, leaving a gap which causes the whole freezer to ice up no matter how careful you are!!!! I finally figured this out! Every time I open or shut it I have to fight the seals on the doors and on the freezer drawer to ensure it's tight, it's brand new!!!! The french doors often don't close without a good slam which does not help the freezer issue. Also, from the get go, I noticed the french doors are not even nor flush. The bottom drawer looks bowed on the inside and it's still missing a part. I don't want this junky refrigerator! My 17 year old Amana worked perfectly even with decrepit seals."

B0052QXY5K,"LG LFX31925ST Super Capacity 3 French Door Refrigerator,",Major Appliances,1,"I am not surprised by the poor reviews that this product receives; what does surprise me is that some customers profess to be satisfied.  It took less than four years for our compressor to break down, disabling both freezer and fridge.  And it took three days to bring in a repair person -- who, when he did arrive, did not have the necessary part to replace the broken one, which means that we must dump all our present food and will be unable to make new food purchases till the new part comes in.  It also compels us to incur daily restaurant or take-out charges in the meantime .  It appears that at least the warranties are being honored (though in no great haste), but the jury is still out on that one, and in any case it does not compensate us for the incidental expenses and the hassles.  Anyone who buys this LG does so at his/her own risk.  Wish we'd had a crystal ball before we took the plunge.  Never again."

My only complaint was, as noted by a couple of others, the installation instructions had the screws in the wrong places. Fortunately, I didn't do the install myself, a pro did it--or the micro would have been on the way back to &#34;home&#34;! The unit matches my other LG appliances, so, I'm pretty happy.

The upper left corner has a cold spot and the milk or juice will develop a little ice but no big deal.  The ice dispenser is in the door so there is more room in the freezer.  It is a little noisy when the ice drops and is a little slow if filling a large container, it is quicker to get the ice right out of the bin.  But everything works great and the water tastes crisp and clean.  I set the freezer to 4 and things freeze very quickly and seem to keep without freezer burn for a long time.  The water filters are a bit pricey but last about 6 months."

I wish I had purchased the larger size first time around.  This product has allowed me to store more wine without worrying about it going bad, especially in the summer months when the inside of my house can reach 78 degrees F or higher, which is much too warm for any bottle of wine.  The product works very well.  It cools the wine down to the set point temperature in very little time.  It looks great, too and is relatively quiet."

It did take a while to cool down the drinks as they were at room temperature, but now they are very cold.  Pretty quiet.  We have in our livingroom and you can occassionaly hear the compressor, but very low and not a disturbance.  With the tv on you can't hear it.  Very pleased with it so far, but it's only been a day now.  Hoping I still feel the same about it in a year.  I did spend the extra $15 for a 2 yr warranty just in case as most appliances don't last like they use to."
B00KYFLHXK,Samsung ME18H704SFS 1.8 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Microwave Oven,Major Appliances,1,"Worst microwave ever.  It no longer heats after less than 3 months.  So I call Samsung who said they would have a tech here on Monday (four days after call) but that I would have to have it uninstalled for the tech to fix it.  I make arrangements for service from HHGregg to come and take it down and get here before Samsung technician does today.  Samsung also said I would get a confirmation call from technician.  Today is Monday and no technician call.  I call Samsung who tells me that they could not initially find a local technician to fix it (I live in Northern VA by Washington DC!).  They did not call me to tell me he was not coming today.  They finally found one in West VA and I could call them and schedule.  I call and they cannot come for another 8 days at best.  That would be 12 days no microwave.  Then I would need to call someone to reinstall the microwave after it is fixed.  That brings me to 2 weeks at best.  I called back Samsung and they said there is nothing they can do.  I said I wanted a new microwave and they said that would be up to the store I bought it from.  I called the store and they said, nope, its been more than 30 days (HHGregg).  Very disappointed."

B00KVMEFMQ,"SPT SD-2202S Countertop Dishwasher with Delay Start, Silver",Major Appliances,5,"[Update]: I have been using for about a month and still in love with it.  No problems at all. Cleans perfectly. Still very happy with this!  --- Didn't use to be a frequent review writer but this dishwasher has proven to be great so really felt like it deserved getting its 5 stars. The unit fits perfectly in our countertop, takes most (all) of the countertop space but it's well worth it.  PROS: - Incredibly easy to install: it took less than 10 minutes to connect the hoses to the back of the unit, and plug into the faucet. - Incredibly easy to connect for each use: after you setup the quickconnect thing on your faucet, plugging the hose to the faucet takes 5 seconds. You connect, open the faucet, get the washer running. Then unplug once its done.  Couldn't be easier. - Have only had the unit for a couple weeks but so far very happy with the cleaning, no complaints with the performance - Relatively quiet:  I was expecting it to be noisy but figured it would be worth dealing with the noise just to have a dishwasher, but was really pleasantly surprised with how quiet it is. Very quiet during cleaning and just a bit of noise once it discharges the water (noise coming from the water hitting the sink, but nothing major). You can watch TV or listen to radio while it operates with no trouble. - Enough capacity for our needs (a couple in a small apt) - No leaks - Chose this model over other models available on amazon because of the color.  I like the metal / grey finish.  CONS: - Relatively heavy: I was able to put up on the sink on my own but some people might need some help to unpack the unit and set it up on the counter.  Overall incredibly happy with the purchase. Easy to install, easy to operate, gets the job done. Best thing you can do with ~$250 to massively improve your daily life!"

Would be 5 stars for use if it weren't for the jackhammer sound effects that sometimes come out of it while it's churning away. But it is installed in the utility room. If this was installed in the kitchen or other high traffic area it would drive me nuts. So solid purchase, but have to be mindful of where it sits."

B00MO6V9HG,Danby products,Major Appliances,5,This fridge works perfectly for me. I have it elevated on an old side table for easy access. It is quiet when running and chills well. The small size is a plus because food does not accumulate and go bad and it is a snap to clean. As a beverage cooler it definitely leaves a lot to be desired. It  does not store wine bottles or tall beer cans well.  The can rack on the door works perfectly for standard 12 oz cans.  The freezer compartment is very small but powerful. It is no problem for me but would annoy someone who makes only occasional trips to buy in bulk or needs tons of ice cubes.  It works well for one or 2 people.  For a weekend cabin or dorm room it would be great.  Energy star rating is a plus!

B00KO90H6Y,Whynter Stainless Steel Cigar Cooler Humidor,Major Appliances,1,"I got this cooler in a week and was very exciting about it. However, the hygrometer is not working to well, it is in fact 71% and the hygrometer shows 58%, but this is minor because you can always use the electric one. The biggest issue I have is it somehow leak inside and the water drop on the tray and my cigars are getting wet from it. That could damage the whole cooler's cigar once the wet one grow mold. I wish the seller can reach to me and solve this issue out, otherwise I will request a return, this leaking is dangerous to my cigars. This product really is very bad, I tried so many time to contact them in vain. I was taking my chance for using it and see if the leaking will go away and I discovered a full box went wet, and some of them are damaged! I am going to return it! I kept the humidity at 60-65% and the fan keep leaking water! It is no worth to take such fine cigar in risk!"
B00AKHRVNW,The Laundry Alternative Vapper Compact Clothes Dryer,Major Appliances,5,"I rent & can't have the typical washer/dryer in my apt.  Laundromats get costly.  I'd been using the Breathing Mobile Washer and then hanging clothes on a rod over the bathtub, since line-drying outside is also not an option.  On days with high humidity though, it can take several days for clothes to dry.  So I decided to get the Vapper after reading all the reviews and watching the You Tube videos.  I let the clothes air-dry over night, they were still very damp this morning.  (Lightweight cotton scrub top)  I put in Vapper and it took it about 15 minutes to dry completely (using the red insert AND the plastic bag).  Then I used it to dry a sheer nylon top, I hung another very thin top over that, 2 pairs of socks and a crop top....all was dry in 20 minutes!!  I had ordered a new hair dryer to go with the Vapper, I should have gotten the one with higher wattage--clothes would dry faster.  Vapper is so easy to use and store when done.  I'll definitely be getting the Vapper for pants next.  Overall, I LOVE the Vapper.  I would definitely buy this item again!!"

Foamy beer, regardless of the brand, pressure settings, etc.  I made a $700 mistake.  Buy another brand or keep going with bottles and cans."
B00P9W153A,LG H/E Ultra large Capacity Top Load Laundry System with Turbo Wash Technology (WT5680HVA_DLEX5680V) ELECTRIC DRYER,Major Appliances,5,"I stayed at the in laws for a weekend and used their wash machine like this feature and I was able to catch up the dirty clothes so we would go back home with less chores to do. No time flat with no back ache I was amazed at how the wash machine adjusted the water level to the load size and that cut waiting time in half! The dryer adjusted itself for the drying time according to the load size as well. Its genius and yes it plays a cute tune when its done, love that too. I am sold and told my husband this is our upgrade right here. We usually have someone that comes every few weeks to get our laundry and does it for me since my L4,5,& 6 is compressed doing the wash is a killer for me and I cant stand the pain but maybe with our upgrade I can do it myself."
B00AW04ZMM,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine 7.9-15lbs with Spin Cycle …,Major Appliances,4,"UPD: AS EXPECTED, the spinner motor went out after a year of service. Never less, the little Panda performed amazingly all that time.  Bought this machine about 5 month ago, brand new. It came nicely packed in one box, no signs of water residue or damage. Plugged in, filled with water and started to do laundry the same hour it arrived and has been using it more or less every other day ever since.  Reason to buy:  newborn in the family, which lives in a tiny apt. in Brooklyn with no room to fit a standard size machine.  Appearance: cheap plastic with no squeaks or sharp chips. Nothing rattles inside.  Capacity: I'm an XL size hog and able to fit 1 of my Levi's denim shirt and 2 office style shirts at the same time. Or 2 denim pants, or all the baby's laundry she manages to dispatch in a week.  Pluses: relatively quiet, though tends to get louder after a cycle or two. Action is VIOLENT, tossing poor laundry left and right, washing away even toughest chit. Self water emptying is a huge plus. Dryer is amazing, spinning things to near-dry condition. Require a likkle drop of detergent compared to a Hercules downstairs in the basement.  Minuses: LINT IS A HUGE PROBLEM. Ye be warned mates, if you have &#34;fluffy&#34; goods to wash, I assure you that the lint will get EVERYWHERE - into the sink (use the fine mesh to catch it), into every crevasses of your load, and I'm yet to find a way to reduce the effect. Buy some extra lint rollers, trust me you'll need them all and they tend to finish right at the wrong moments. Some recommended a laundry mesh, me skeptical yarr. Power cord is short to reach an outlet high up, like mine in the light fixture on top of the mirror, so I've got a $0.99 extension in the nearby store. Better use the High Efficiency Turbo detergent, regular one produces a lot of foam and require extra rinse. No wheels so you have to carry it around.  Resume: for the money it is absolutely amazing little machine which will save you time and money and will washup stuff just like it's &#34;bigger brothers&#34;, a must for a tiny living spaces."

B002YMW5J6,"Whynter WC-321DD 32 Bottle Dual Temperature Zone Wine Cooler, Stainless Steel Trimmed Glass Door with Black Cabinet",Major Appliances,1,9 months after I purchased this product one side of the unit stopped working. Realizing it was under warranty I contacted Whynter the manufacturer whom requested I send their services department pictures of the unit so they can try and blame me for not properly placing the unit in a well ventilated area. After I disagreed with their accusation (the unit was 6 inches away from any wall and free from all foreign objects) I was requested to disassemble the back of the unit and take more pictures. It was requested that I replace a fuse on the circuit board and determine if the heat syncs were hot (they were - ouch!). I was finally informed that they believe the unit needed a circuit board replaced and I had 2 options: I could ship the unit back to them for repair or I could have a repair technician come out and install it as it requires soldering. When I asked about reimbursement they offered a potential shipping discount at my expense (shipping the unit back at my expense would incur a cost of over $150) and they will only reimburse me up to $65 for the repair (though there’s not a repair service in my area that would even entertain sending a technician out for less than $100). I have unlimited resources to spend troubleshooting an inferior product so I scheduled to have a technician come out to install the replacement part. That did not fix the issue but guess what? Having the technician perform the repair services voided my warranty. Could you believe it? What a clever little loophole. So now I have a $500 piece of junk I can’t even throw away without incurring more cost. This company does not value their customers or stands by the quality of their product so please do yourself a favor and purchase a refrigerator from a manufacturer you can trust.
B000JLNBW4,Koolatron Coke Personal Mini Fridge,Major Appliances,1,"It lasted just about a year.  Does not keep drinks really cold.  You have to slam the door to make sure it is secure.

The part to repair it is over 250 dollars not counting labor.  Taking it to the junk and never buying another Whirlpool washer.  Whirlpool did not care that they sold me a lemon.
B00O06XCIM,Frigidaire 242294502 Refrigerator Water Filter Bypass,Major Appliances,5,"This is a BLANK. Not a filter. I was having trouble like a lot of the other post. I was not getting good ice production and it would not keep up. We have two people using it and not every day and still was having issues. Now we are getting plenty of ice and the water flow is much faster.<br /><br />I haven't put an inline filter in the back like some but we haven't noticed any difference in the taste. I may do this at a later date. According to the manufacturer, this is the reason for the blank but I was just looking for better performance and this solved my problem."
B00O2N3JDG,Danby products,Major Appliances,5,Love this compact refrigerator!  The only fridge I have ever purchased that actually chilled things properly.  I would highly recommend if you are looking at purchasing a small refrigerator.  Well worth the money!

Arrived Used and full of water. If you sell me something used at least drain the water out of it. Even the hoses came with some gross mildew stuff all over them. I didn't even use them, bought some new ones.  REVISED: It shakes a lot. You will know its on in your house when you use it. Don't forget to go over the Install instructions! You need to do a couple things to it before you use it. I am returning it but if you do not mind a shaker then maybe this is for you<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it shakes way to much for me, came used, and it cut my finger with some piece of metal on the bottom that should not of been there (attached picture)"

B004MX8XO6,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,1,"It leaks . . . substantially.  I have had this product for approximately 6 months.  After about 2 months, I noticed water on my countertop.  I kept using it but just put paper towels down underneath, which seemed to fix the problem (still more convenient for me to clean up the paper towels than to actually do my own dishes).  At this point, however, the flooding is just too much.  I'm not going through the headache of sending this back to the manufacturer.  I can't even imagine what the freight' charges would be on that.<br /><br />And just so we are clear, it is not leaking from the hoses. That was my first thought and they are consistently.  It leaks somewhere from the bottom."
B002GZND6U,Supco RIM597 Universal Icemaker,Major Appliances,5,Was an exact-fit replacement for #S 106 626640 and super-easy installation. Only thing I had to do was trim out a small piece of plastic for the water inlet which was easy (it offers side or rear water inlet) and tighten 3 screws.<br /><br />Only downside is that I waited so long (assuming the part would be too expensive to bother with).

B00RDFXT7Q,LG WM3370HWA 4.3 cu. ft. Front-Load Washer with 9 Wash Cycles in White,Major Appliances,5,"This is an excellent machine!  Plenty of cycles, ability to use a little more water if you like with the &#34;Water Plus&#34; button, and very good build quality.  We've had the machine for about a month so I can't speak to longevity but as long as it lasts, this is a great buy.  Love the ability to &#34;sanitize&#34;: that takes about a 2 hour wash cycle but you can be sure that all the germs/bacteria are cleared off the items in question.  Very simple operation with the center dial but you can go as complex as you like with the control panel.  If this is your first front loader (it was for me), be sure to leave the door open after each wash so the machine can dry out."
B00GIR1G5M,Gap Cap for Stovetops,Major Appliances,5,Does the job
B00L7QVSXE,Freezer,Major Appliances,3,"It was just what I was looking for and works great.  However, the power cord was wedged behind a large black unit - motor or condenser?  It took a lot of coaxing to get out.  The way it was, I find it hard to believe that it was not done during manufacturing. Besides that, there is a very noticeable dent in the middle of the door. Otherwise I am satisfied with the product."
B00GI3NA5A,"AKDY New 30"" European Style Island Mount Stainless Steel Range Hood Vent Swiping Sensor Control W/Both Side Accessible Control AZ-H601C-75",Major Appliances,5,"We absolutely love this range hood, but it is a beating to install.  My husband ended up having to shorten the metal brackets with a hacksaw, because they would have caused the range to hang quite a bit lower than what we needed.  Overall, my husband and father were able to install it themselves (they're both quite handy with contractor experience), but I think the average homeowner might struggle with installation.  Once it's up, it looks and functions amazingly well.  Plus, the double sided controls are perfect for our island use application!  I have gotten many compliments on the design of the hood, and would purchase again."
B003TOFVP8,"Amana 3.5 -Cubic Foot Front Load Washer, NFW7300WW, White",Major Appliances,1,This product is garbage. Don't buy Amana. This is the worst company. My washer literally jumped off the platform and the drum came off the spring and broke plastic inside the wash machine. Courtney informed us that there is &#34;nothing they can do&#34; beyond charging me to send a technician out in 8 days. Meanwhile my wet clothes are all over the floor. This machine is less than 5 years old. This company and this machine are absolute garbage.

B00U7XIS86,Samsung RF23J9011SR 22.5 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,4,Everything is great with this fridge. My only complaint would have to be the water pressure coming out of the front of the unit. It's super strong and water splashes everywhere. All the time. I used to complain about low pressure refrigerators and how long it would take to fill a glass but now I understand why they have to be that way... To save yourself from having to clean up water all day.

This is the last Samsung product I will buy.
B00K5RF7IS,"Maytag Neptune Washer Front Loader (2) Bearings, Seal and Washer Kit 12002022",Major Appliances,2,"I purchased this thinking it would be simple to install after reading the reviews and watching some related videos online. It may have been if there were directions as to which bushing to use and which way they went in. I thought I had it right, but nope. Pulling it all apart and redoing the whole thing would have been avoided had the supplier given any directions at all. When I contacted them they said to look online. Spend a few $ more and get a known supplier of the bearings (no part numbers on these foreign ones) and some instructions you'll be better off. Overall once you do the job a few times (as I had to), it's pretty easy.<br /><br />Well it lasted less than one year, the jet sounds again like it want to take off! Time to try another supplier."
B00CDWTQKI,"The Laundry Alternative Nina Soft Spin Dryer, Ventless Portable Electric Dryer. 3 Year Warranty, 127V, 60 Hz",Major Appliances,2,"I was looking for a 110 volt dryer, which I discovered was expensive and there wasn't any used that I could find. I saw the info on this and thought if would be a big help for me. Not. This machine is basically the spin cycle on your dryer if you respin your dryer again. It does not really dry your clothes, plus it is so small everything is wrinkled. The info also states that it uses a standard outlet. What they failed to mention was a standard 3-prong outlet. My apt. is in an older home so I only have a standard outlet. I am so disappointed it did not work out for me."

I recently built an 8' x 10' kitchen in the lower level of the home I purchased with my kids. Because the space is so small and I didn't need a full size stove / oven, I opted for just a two burner gas cook top. This had the best reviews so I chose this one. Very glad I did. Excellent quality, works great and I don't have any complaints. I have used it a few times and the flame range is good and the foods I cooked came out perfect. If you are looking for a natural gas two burner cook top, this is a great choice."

We bought it from a locally owned company who installed it perfectly (I've heard that these machines don't install exactly like most washers, so perhaps it is better to have a good installer).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Huge capacity.  My husband and son compete in judo and this washer will wash a week's worth of gis easily.  The lack of a tall agitator means that I don't have to stuff bulky items like gis and comforters around one anymore!<br />-Cleans well.  Our clothes come out really clean.<br />-Amazing spin cycle.  The extra fast spin cycle gets so much water out that clothes and linens take less time to dry in the dryer or hanging.<br />-High efficiency: Since the washer is high efficiency, we use less water and less detergent.<br />-Intuitive controls: I love how simple this washer is to work. And there is a cycle for everything.<br /><br />Cons: none, really, except that you pay a bit more to get all the &#34;pros.&#34;<br />If something changes, or I experience breakage of parts, etc. like some other reviews, I will update!"

The ice maker issues are a nightmare (Samsung is aware of them but of course does not stand behind their manufacturer flaws). We have 7 people in our family and I really don't even find the size a problem but the cold water volume and ice volumes are ridiculously small---even for one person. Plan on having to replace your icemaker and deal with multiple issues surrounding this.<br />Really sad because I have other Samsung items that we like but will definitely never buy this brand again.

B00NO58JLK,EdgeStar 1.1 Cu. Ft. Medical Freezer with Lock,Major Appliances,5,I purchased this to replace a super-noisy Haier which threw craps after 8 months.  This thing is so quiet I thought at first there was something wrong with it.  The quality of its construction is  hugely better than the unit it replaces.  Only time will reveal its longevity factor but it is looking good at this early stage.  If you want a small freezer buy this quick because my online research reveals that the manufacturer may have discontinued it.
B0047PYBNG,"Frigidaire FFWC35F4L 35 Bottle Wine Cooler with Bright Lighting,",Major Appliances,4,"Very quiet and a good size. Holds a good amount of bottles. It took a week to get it to the right temperature. Contrary to others, I found it runs a bit warmer and doesn't necessarily get too cold. The air comes through at the bottom so it's a bit uneven, making the bottles not the lower shelves colder than those at the top, but overall it's pretty good. I'd definitely recommend it for a basic fridge."

B000WEH750,Sunpentown WC-20TL ThermoElectric with Touch Sensitive Controls 20-Bottle Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,1,"An earlier model (WC-20SD) that I have had for 8 years and gave great service finally went dead so I bought this updated and much nicer looking replacement. The two units are identical in size and specs and are supposed to be able to cool 20 bottles of wine down to 54 degF assuming the ambient temperature is not more than 86 degF. ie. Specs state it can only drop the temperature by 32 degF. The earlier model had no problem cooling to 54 degF and did so as long as I had it. The new model, installed in the exact same under counter location with 5 inches of clearance all round, can only manage to cool to 57 degF. I have measured the surrounding temperature and it's barely 82 degF. The main difference I observe is that the older model had two 3 inch fans cooling the hot side of the heat sink, whereas the new model has one 4 inch. 12/2/2015 update. I've dropped it to one star from my original 3 star. When I bought it in July I was giving it the benefit of the doubt since my ambiant temperature was 82F. It's now December and the ambiant is 73F and it still can't hit a setpoint of 54F.  Add to that , its fan is noisy and always speeding up then down about every 5 seconds."
B002HT0958,Mini Portable Countertop Spin Dryer,Major Appliances,5,"Before buying the dryer I saw how it worked on youtube. When I read the directions on how many items can be dryer it states 2-3 items at a time. They really need to put more details in the directIons. I loaded the dryer with the correct amount of clothes turned it on and the dryer shook and rattled loudly. But I remember the youtube video and there was none of that just a smooth humming sound. I learned by taking one item at a time and shaping it into a circle, (a clothes doughnut) and pushing the items close to the sides of the machine leaving a hole in the middle, the dryer did not shake or rattle loudly. The directions should also say do not dry heavy weight or large item, like jeans or shoes. Once I learned how to load the dryer correctly it worked quieter, I am super happy I bought the dryer. Now I do not have to wait for my clothes to dry over night. I hang up my items turn on a fan and my clothes are dry in 30-60 minutes (depending on how thick the items I dried are it my take longer to dry)."
B003B7Y9AG,"LG LRG3095ST30"" Stainless Steel Gas Sealed Burner Range - Convection",Major Appliances,2,"Pros:  I like the convection oven.  It bakes very well and very evenly.  I also like the stainless steel finish.  It doesn't streak or show fingerprints.<br />Cons:  Although I am a intelligent and well educated person and can manage technology well, it took me about a year (yes, I said a year) to figure out how to use the digital display screen.  Turning the oven on and setting the timer are not intuitive and the processes are different.  It was very frustrating.  I've figured out its idiosyncrasies now, and am feeling better about my ability to turn on my oven and set the timer.<br />When the timer goes off it sings a beautiful little tune.  This is great as long as you are in the same or an adjacent room, but if you are upstairs you can't hear it.  I must echo other reviewers who say the back burners are just for warming.  They are so weak they will not allow anything to boil.  Also, I was really excited about the griddle.  After trying to use it for about a month, I gave up and went back to plugging in my electric griddle.  It just didn't ever heat up properly.  I think the griddle burner needs more power.  Although this is my first gas range in about 10 years, I have found the burners give out a lot of heat which is hard if you are standing by the stove cooking.  You will feel cooked yourself. After using the range for exactly three years the LCD display is starting to break.  We looked online and discovered it is a capacitor problem which will probably cost $200 to fix. Also, after the first time I used the self-cleaning feature of the oven, the blue paint started to blister from the heat.  Each time I use the self-cleaning feature more blue paint blisters so my oven constantly looks pitted and dirty.  Obviously, the pretty blue interior is just that, pretty until you use the self clean and then it turns ugly.  I would rather have the standard, durable grey interior.  Pretty does not rank over durable.  I wish this oven was designed better and was more durable.  I would not recommend it for anyone who is looking for a quality product."
B00BXPEWDC,Waring Pro Snow Cone Maker,Major Appliances,5,"I tried several ice crusher and this is the best I've ever bought.  Fantastic...makes a mound of shaved ice quickly and is very easy to use, even for small children.  Beware machines that require you to make round ice balls first or have small loading shuts.

B00O1BU6OO,"SAMSUNG NE58H9970WS Slide-In Induction Range, 30-Inch, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,5,"This appliance is a work of art.  Everything about this range is beautiful.  You'll want to buff it daily like a new car's chrome.  The upper oven is small, but that works to our advantage.  It actually heats up quicker than our toaster oven.  It's so much better, that we have replaced our toaster over with a basic toaster since anything that needs to have a small oven can be done here.  The lower oven is great especially when you need to cook two things at once.  For example, we've used the top oven to defrost a couple of frozen dinners and a pizza for picky guests while the bottom one cooks a ham for the rest.<br /><br />The stovetop is in a class by itself.  It needs its own paragraph.  The induction method is without a doubt the best way to cook.  If this is your first induction, stay away from stainless steel, as it's really only for cooks that really know what they're doing.  Best bet is an aluminum set made for induction with nonstick interiors like the epicurious from jcpenney.  Once you use the induction, you'll never want to use standard electric again.  Besides the obvious factors like quicker and even heating, cool to the touch, and ease of use, it sports the enhanced lighting, the auto detection that shuts off the range when no pot is detected, and did i mention the virtual flames?<br /><br />ART and function have met."

It`s the reviews on here that speak for themselves. You can lead a horse to water but you can` t make him drink. Geesh!  The gas dryer is ADGE8RGS113TW01.

It cooks so evenly and works perfect every time I use it.  I think that with newer stoves you are not supposed to leave the door open when broiling so that might address the heat that is coming out in one of the reviews.  Anyway we love it and use it all the time.  Not a problem in almost 6 mos. of ownership.

Seems they have compressor problems or something else causes the compressor to fail.  Their support is abysmal until they send someone out but the technician in the field contradicts what the phone support says - IE it's normal for the fridge to run constantly and creating fan/whirring noises, the ice maker isn't expected to maintain the temp of the ice.

It doesn't get a ton of use since it's only 3 of us in the house and most of the day we're not here.<br /><br />I've been buying OEM only filter and have been very hesitant to buy anything else since I've had pretty bad experiences buying 3rd party ink cartridges and things like that. When it comes to your drinking water you don't want to mess around. Especially with a toddler in the house.<br /><br />I decided to give this thing a trial run and update my review ever few weeks.<br /><br />So far I have to give it 5 stars and here's why:<br /><br />- packaged arrived on time and perfectly sealed and boxed. Assuming that it was sanitized before packaging, I have every reason to beleieve it still is so.<br /><br />- the box has instructions on the outside and the filter itself has a sticker seal to protect it.<br /><br />- I followed the instructions on the box and it installed exactly the same way as my OEM filter.<br /><br />- during the flushing period of 5 gallons, I heard a few air pockets but it stopped well before I was done.<br /><br />- water flow has not changed at all. Nice and fast.<br /><br />- The water tastes great<br /><br />- The price is half of the OEM filter<br /><br />I'll update in a few weeks."

But now I am waiting for the machine to finish washing, started at 11 this morning, it is now 2:42 PM. This machine is so picky when it comes to balancing. You need to baby sit the machine to be sure that when it shuts down due to an imbalanced load, you catch it right away. If not, you will be washing one load all day. By the way, it is still not done lolol. I would be very happy to trade it in for just an old fashioned machine! It is a day later and still trying to get through one load. In addition to the operational problems, I have had intermittent leaks from underneath. I did have it raised up to identify the source of the leak however, it wont happen if you watch. Believe all the low reviews, maybe the 5 stars just got lucky!"
B00BJPXXEA,Igloo Ice Maker,Major Appliances,5,"We absolutely love this ice maker. Besides making ice whenever you want, you can take it with you. It's great for a camper. I'm writing this review a full year after the purchase, and am now adding some comments since someone sent me a question about the machine. Yes, it does come with a scoop. Plus there is a nice plastic basket that catches the ice cubes. It's quick and efficient. You fill it with the water--you don't need a water source. I've been using bottled water because our tap water is from the well and has some calcium in it that could possibly accumulate on the mechanism and cause it not to work. I saw that a couple other people had complained that their unit quit working. I'm wondering if maybe they also have calcium in their water. Calcium builds up in faucets and pipes and is what caused the ice maker in our refrigerator to stop working. Rather than pay over $300 to fix the refrigerator's ice maker, we bought this one. We liked that we would be able to make it double for our camper as well as our house. This machine makes ice fairly quickly. NOBODY paid me to say these things. I bought it full price after researching several. Also, you can purchase an extended warranty on it if you want. We bought the extended warranty, but it doesn't look like we needed to. Over a year later, I'm very happy with this purchase. Plus the cool thing is if you Amazon Prime, the shipping's free."

B00ENOTM94,JVM7195SFSS,Major Appliances,4,This microwave looks great and has all the features I wanted. I bought this to replace a 15 year old GE Spacemaker microwave.<br />It has all the features of the one I had and more. My only complaint is the instructions and the paper that the instructions and templates<br />are printed on are very thin and not that easy to see. My older microwave's manuals and template were normal paper. My new one is not. GE is apparently trying to save money on paper. Why would you build a high quality microwave and then try to save money by using cheap paper? The manuals were a bit hard to read on this cheap paper but my main problem was attempting to tape the template that goes on the bottom of the cabinet you will be mounting the microwave under. The paper was so thin that the only part that stayed in place when you held it against the bottom of the cabinet was where you had your hand. The rest of it just collapses and hangs down making it very hard for one person to tape it. GE if you are going to go cheap on the paper at least put the templates on stiffer/thicker paper. Other than the paper complaint and instructions not being the easiest to understand the microwave itself is very nice and I have no problem recommending it.

The front panel indicator lights are signaled however have different colors,   ~~~ The time light is a gaudy orange color.

They knew immediately what the problem was and for a tiny little plastic part and $72 dollars there was a fix we could do ourselves. They even had a generic instruction sheet on how to replace the part. The instructions were vauge and weren't very specific to our model. We were able to replace the part and now it works again. I think they should replace the part for the known problem for free.

B0017Y3GGI,"NewAir AI-100R 28-Pound Portable Icemaker, Red",Major Appliances,2,"Year 2: If you run your Newair constantly (like I do) you can count on replacing the water holder  (the piece that attaches to the rotary motor pump housing) and water pump every year. Year 1 I replaced the water holder and water pump. Year 2 the water pump went out. I replaced that. Shortly after that I noticed the water holder was cracking again. I was going to try and fix it with Loctite but then the compressor went out. OK, time to replace the entire unit as in total I already spent $90 replacing parts. I decided to get the same one because all of the other brands (except one that got really good ratings but is too big) will have the same problem i.e. cheap plastic parts etc. So I yanked out all the parts from the old one that I can reuse in the replacement.<br /><br />(Prior Post) I updated my review from last year. So a little over a year has gone by. The water hold that holds the water for freezing into cubes cracked down the side where it attaches to the motor. Apparently, this is a common problem. Hopped on Youtube and luckily a guy posted 3 videos on how to fix it. After spending 2 hours wrangling to get the thing out, and waiting for the epoxy to dry, I spent another hour getting it put back together. It started making ice (awesome I thought), then quit. It cracked even worse down the side. So I called today for a replacement part from Newair. $20 plus $9.95 for shipping. What a ripoff for a nothing plastic part."

B00T6OB50A,"Speed Queen AWN432SP 26"" Top Load Washer with 3.3 cu. ft. Capacity, in White",Major Appliances,1,"Although I did not purchase the washer on Amazon, I want to warn consumers about Speed Queen products. I purchased the AWN432SP washer and the ADE4BR dryer. Prior to this purchase, I had owned Kenmore and Maytag. Because Speed Queen is American-made and seems to be rated high among users, I felt confident in my decision. What a big, expensive mistake! The wash cycles are far too short. If you set the second rinse, there is a 2-3 minute delay before it begins. I have had the set less than a month, and the tub is already becoming discolored. Also, the dryer has rust forming. I have complained to both Speed Queen and my retailer to no avail. In summary, do NOT buy Speed Queen!!!! You will be VERY sorry."

I went for the push button over the pull handle since these small models are so light you can end up pulling them off the counter.  Has lots of features for a small unit.  We've been running it at home for a while to break it in and make sure it doesn't fail early -- so far it's worked great.

Even so, we've had a toasty summer and have found this ice maker to be a great addition to our home.  It works exactly as described.  We keep it on all day and turn it off in the evening.  Works great if you have hot, thirsty employees, neighbors, friends....I've offered lots of folks a cup of ice cold water these days.<br />The ice maker is a little noisy when actually making and spitting out the ice cubes, but other than that it's very quiet.  Nice stainless finish, easy to clean and even easier to use."

B00434YUBO,Whirlpool Duet WFW94HEXW 27 Front-Load Washer 5.0 cu. ft. Capacity - White,Major Appliances,1,I had the repairman out to fix the washing machine.  He said the thumping sound was a bearing for the back of the drum.  It was almost $500 for the bearing kit and then there was the labor.  He said it wasn't worth it and to just use it until we couldn't stand the noise any more then replace it.  (He doesn't work for an appliance retailer so he wasn't trying to make a sale.) About a month or so later the main control board went out on the dryer.  Too many repairs in such a short time.  So after 6 years we trashed them and bought a new washer and dryer.  Not Whirlpool of course.

I did not have a cabinet, as I was replacing a vent hood, so I installed a shelf and used a duct cover instead.<br /><br />It wasn't handled with care by UPS, so the top was dented up.

B00LBPKVES,Haier HLP24E 1.5 Cubic Foot Portable Washer With Stainless Steel Tub. Our Compact Washing Machine Offers 4 Wash Cycles and Is Ideal for Small Spaces. This Portable Washing Machine Has LED Display For Easy Use. Enjoy Your Portable Washingmachine.,Major Appliances,5,"Not really portable, because it is rather heavy, but does have a carrying handle on each side, so that helps. The hose it comes with is rather short, but if you buy a garden hose at home depot, you can lengthen the distance between your faucet and the washer by screwing one end to the faucet connector, then the other end to the included hose. Make sure you connect the correct end to the washing machine, because if you try directly connecting the hose and not using the included pipe at all it will leak. Also, don't forget to use the little wire clip to connect the drain hose ... because if you don't, it's definitely going to leak.<br /><br />Just did my first load of a laundry in it last night, and it did a great job! You just leave the faucet on the whole time, and it'll leak water out when the washer isn't using it, then when the washer needs it, it's there. Surprisingly quiet. Also has an awesome spin cycle ... I left my clothes out to air dry, and they were dry when I got up this morning."

I accepted it anyway because it would not be visible. I noticed, too, that the w/d boxes had a number of places with holes which could have caused additional dings. But, very attractive! BTW, word to the wise--don't be as dumb as I was. Do NOT buy to use as stacking units. Yes, they DO stack, but the top controls are unreachable unless you are 6 feet. I was lucky that I could still use them as side by side units. My fault for not paying more attention. Overall, except for my own error, I am pleased with these units."

B003RC9TNC,Samsung 24 In. Stainless Steel Dishwasher - DMT800RHS,Major Appliances,1,"Current Samsung appliances are all repair nightmares.When we remodeled 2 years ago we purchased all new Samsung appliances, including this model dishwasher, a refrigerator, a microwave, a washer and dryer. IN JUST 2 YEARS THEY HAVE ALL HAD ISSUES. After just 18 months the dishwasher has stopped working and error code 9E. It is possible to uninstall the dishwasher, disassemble it, clear all the hoses and flush out the sealed plastic part that contains the water level float and get it to work for a few weeks. Cheap parts and bad design are apparent in all their current appliances. Just spent over $300 to replace the failed circuit board in the refrigerator. The touch panel on the microwave have been replaced 2 times and the whole microwave replaced once (under warranty in the first year) and it still turns on random functions in the middle of the night (fan starts running, light turns on). The washer and dryer have been the least problematic, but front loading washer has a filter that must be cleaned every couple of months or the machine quits working, and it is impossible to clean the filter without leaking several cups of water on the floor. The dryer just stops occasionally with an error code and \\""rebooting\\"" (disconnecting the power and plugging back in) seems to solve the issue."
B007PKOMWU,Danby  Freestanding Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,1,"Wouldn't cool wine to our preference even after we had set it at the lowest thermostat setting.  Had to transfer the bottles into the big kitchen fridge prior to consuming them. 1 month later ice has started to form inside the cabinet, with one side freezing the wine bottles and the other side being at room temperature.  Checked Amazon return policy and, of course, all of our issues arose after the 30-day return policy had expired.  I will try to find someone to repair this P.O.S, but I'm not holding my breath."

B00IY7BNUW,Avalon Bay Portable Ice Maker,Major Appliances,5,"Fabulous! Makes ice very quick and keeps up with my ice needs better than any freezer ice maker has. Followed others suggestions and left it upright for 24 hours before starting machine. Also, the first cubes it makes are puny, so I just dump them back and start using from the second batch. They are opaque cubes, not clear, which I know many people were asking about, but they have a great crunch factor so if you chew ice you'll be pleased. It is not silent, but no louder than a box fan on low, quieter than my dishwasher or dryer that's for sure. Doesn't take up much space, much the same as a toaster, just taller. I wish I had bought one of these years ago and happy I went this route rather than spending about the same to repair my freezers ice maker which didn't keep up with me in the summer.<br />Update: 5/23/16: Machine is still going strong and keeping up with my demands. I just keep letting it run when I need it and dump ice into my ice box in my freezer. People have come over and wonder why I don't fix my freezer and then the see how fast this guy runs and understand."

B000WEH750,Sunpentown WC-20TL ThermoElectric with Touch Sensitive Controls 20-Bottle Wine Cooler,Major Appliances,2,Bought the wine rack in Aug 2013.  Worked fine for the 1st 1.5 years.  It does not hold longer bottles.  For the past 3 months the temp fluctuates between 54 (our setting) and 63.  Very random.  Would have expected to last longer.  Will now spend a bit more money for one that holds longer bottles and hopefully will last more than 2 years.
B00413447C,Kitchenaid KUDE40FXSS Superba Series EQ Dishwasher,Major Appliances,1,"Some of the other reviewers have said it as well... this is a trouble prone piece of work. I've experienced the rack wheels falling off MULTIPLE times. Kitchenaid evidently feels that those are consumable items and you should be willing to pay $40 or so every 6 months or so to replace them. I've replaced seals because it leaked from beneath. Now, less than 3 years in, it's leaking again and I have had it. No more Kitchenaid crap."

Replacement box even more so, but thankfully only minor damage. The sheet metal can't be fore than 20 gauge. So thin that moderate finger pressure will bend it. Useless filter. Light shield is pretty lame. Seems to have good airflow and is pretty quiet. Not done running new duct outside (have to go through brick veneer. The hood probably will not make it for more than a couple of years - and at that point I'll upgrade to at least a 16 gauge just like my old Jenn-Aire."

B00S9AHWOK,"LG WM3570HVA 27-Inch Front-Load Washer with 4.3 Cubic Feet Capacity, Graphite Steel",Major Appliances,3,"I just purchased the LG WM3570HVA washer 3 weeks ago.  I have had a front loader before.  My major complaint about this machine pertains to the rinse cycle.  It simply does not adequately remove the soap from the clothes.  I spoke with LG about the problem and tried all their suggestions to no avail.  My last wash cycle used 2 tablespoons of Tide powder HE detergent. I chose the Normal Cotton cycle, three rinse cycles and heavily soiled clothes (as per LG suggestion to get more water).  The load took 2  hours and 4 minutes to complete and after the third rinse cycle, there was still soap foaming in the water.  I had a service technician from Sears come out and check it and he told me that only seeing a few cups of water in the bottom of the drum was normal.  Most of the water sprays into the clothes.  In an attempt to be &#34;efficient&#34; and use less water, I think the front loaders have gone to far.  There simply must be sufficient water to actually rinse the clothes.  The rinse cycle spends a great deal of time flipping the clothes around and doing nothing.  I have even tried adding another rinse and spin cycle for rinse number 4 to get the soap out.  I simply don't have the time to spend over 2 hours on one load of clothes.  Other than that, the wash cycle is great, and the spin cycle extracts water very well.  It is a quiet machine and is easy to use.  I like the drain hose at the base of the machine that lets you eliminate water from the pan to avoid that mildew smell.  I would rather have more water in one good rinse cycle than have to rinse clothes 3-4 times thus using far more water."

B004Y264RI,KitchenAid KBFS25EWMS Architect Series II 24.8 cu. ft. French Door Refrigerator - Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,2,"I have had the refrigerator for just over 5 years.  The first 3 or so years were ok.  The refrigerator looks nice but always seemed to make a lot of noise and sounded noisy then lower models I have owned even while being a renter.  After 3 1/2 years, everything started happening.  First the compressor and cooling line needed to be replaced, luckily that was under full warranty.  Then 6 months after that, the main computer board that regulates the refrigerator's temperatures went bad, and that was not under warranty!  Several hundreds of $$ later, issue resolved.  Then six months later, guess what?  Leak in the cooling line and compressor started going bad again.  Parts for this repair would have been covered under manufacturer warranty, but labor was not so the estimated repair was around $700.  At this point I am going to get a new refrigerator, not a Kitchen Aid this time just in case.<br /><br />AS FYI, alll three times the refrigerator had problems, the symptoms were always the same.  The freezer temperature would increase to 8, 9, 10 up to 14 degrees, then go back to 0 only to happen again numerous times throughout the day/week.  Eventually it stop returning back to 0 degrees and the refrigerator portion also increased in temperature until both sections no longer cooled."

Most reviews point out the good and near silent washing performance but that is where this washer starts.<br /><br />I had a GE model before this and this one is clearly superior. Everything about the design has been thought through. Even though this is the same exterior size as my GE model, the interior arrangement of the washing heads and the brilliant 3rd draw mean that you can put a lot more stuff inside and its just.... .... easier - you somehow don't have to spend time trying to arrange everything in the dishwasher to fit, it kind of just does.<br /><br />The display and look of the dishwasher is clean too. The ugly buttons are concealed and the inconspicuous dot on the floor tells you when the washer is running - just one example of how they really thought through how people would like to interact with this appliance.<br /><br />The washing performance is outstanding and as others have noticed its practically silent. I regret getting plastic plumbing in my house because the dishwasher makes no noise and then when it discharges the dirty water in to the drains the sound of the water flowing through my plastic plumbing is by far the noisiest thing that happens in the entire cycle.<br /><br />I find the drying performance very good, but as others have noticed Bosch's choice of its ultra low energy condensation drying scheme does have the downside that it doesn't sterilize the interior of the dishwasher with every cycle. So far I there is only one person in the house and so I only run the dishwasher once every few days and I do notice odors building up inside the machine."

It happened after the warranty expired. I called Samsung's support number and was told we're out of luck.

Same response: out of warranty. So sorry.<br /><br />We won't EVER buy Samsung appliances again. Maybe if Apple made appliances, Samsung could just rip off the Apple design and make a slightly poorer version. That would be MUCH better than their current effort!"
B00PGFGVB6,EasyGoDryer - Portable Electric Air Drying Clothes Dryer,Major Appliances,2,"The company itself has great customer service, but the product needs work.<br /><br />I loved this for about the first month. It worked great. I loved how quiet the motor was, and that it dried my hanging clothes well and reasonably fast. I was even tossing a couple of dryer sheets in the bottom to have that, &#34;fresh out of the dryer&#34; smell. I was happy with my purchase. But then the motor just shorted out and quit, rendering the product completely useless. I was disappointed<br /><br />I called customer service. They apologized and said they would refund my money. It was back in my account the next day!<br /><br />Had this company not been so wonderful on the phone, this would have been a scathing review. However wonderful they were, the product needs work. The motor is badly made, shorts out easily and the frame of the dryer is flimsy. The hanging bars also fall off constantly dropping your laundry to the bottom of the dryer.<br /><br />This is a great concept, and could be a great little dryer with a little redesign and quality check. I'm hoping the company will retool this a little."
B00KY5V4M4,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine with Spin Dryer,Major Appliances,4,Despite the negative reviews this machine so far is working good. I've used it a half dozen times now and no problems it works great. Clothes are clean and spin dryer just leave clothes almost dry. You may want to use a laundry bag so clothes don't tangled. It takes a little bit of extra work but definitely beats going to laundry mat. Yes I recommend it to anyone who lives in a apartment or dorm.
B003XEF7DK,10 Washing Machine Lint Traps Aluminum Mesh With Clamps,Major Appliances,5,We bought a new house and it came with a washing machine and a wash sink so we needed to buy new lint traps. We looked at the store and while they are not expensive they are much less expensive buying in bulk.  We know this is not something we will stop needing so buying 10 was not an issue.  I took my old trap off and installed this with out an issue.  The trap appears to be working great. I was so happy with this set I gave part to my parents for their house.
B00TEE5L5W,Best Price for Leveluk-R on Amazon!,Major Appliances,5,"Bought one of these from the Enagic Company themselves. Best machine ever!. It produces Kangen Alkaline water, Neutral water and Beauty Water. I give the neutral to my 1 year old and my husband and I drink the 9.5 alkaline water. If ever we have to drink bottled water, it burns our mouth and tastes salty. When your body gets used to the best it is very difficult to go back to the old stuff. We feel hydrated with this and we drink a lot more water without getting that bloated or stuffed feeling. So far we've gotten his mother, twin sister, grandparents and aunt & uncle to drink this as well and they feel the difference. We are running a water refill factory from our kitchen! Oh did I mention that we cook with this as well? Food-especially brown rice-cook SSSOOO much faster and tastes 100% better. SERIOUSLY!!!! I hated brown rice but now that we use this water, it comes out soft and fluffy and in less time. That's the only type of rice we eat now. :)"

It makes the same type of ice that my fridge does, only a lot faster. Crescent shape cube.  I keep mine out in the garage, it's pretty hot here in the summer and it still makes over 20lbs of ice a day.  Makes great iced tea and iced coffee.  We spend a lot of time outside at games, bbq's, the pool. So its main job for us is filling coolers to keep the cans cold. The neighbors run out of ice sometimes and it covers them too.

B00FHX9UQK,"Avanti Model DWE1802SS Built-In Dishwasher, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,1,I had this installed yesterday. It worked this morning... It now only makes a humming noise and no longer works. I have had terrible luck with 18 inch dishwashers. I have apartments that are too small to accommodate a full size dishwasher. This experience has made me decide to remove all dishwashers and replace the space with extra cabinets. New tenants will have to do their dishes by hand... If you are going to purchase one of these I would get the longest extended warranty you can with it. In my experience full size dishwashers will last about ten years. 18 inch dishwashers must be pampered and even then seem to only last a year or two. I expect much more from a 400-500 dollar appliance. My installer threw away the packaging and it made the return quite difficult... Hold onto your box if you have space for it.
B004N4MSPO,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"I have been using this compact dishwasher for about a year and a half.  Hooking it to the faucet is very easy. The dishwasher is excellent for the price, washes everything clean and bright. It has many washing options depending on the load or how dirty your dishes are. You can technically put large pots in it and it will wash fine, but since it's a compact washer large pans and pots occupy so much space therefore I don't usually put those. Still good for sauce pans and smaller pots though. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase.<br />Update: 2.5 years after my purchase and this little monster is working as good as the first day. I have experienced zero problems and dishes comes out clean and shiny after each load. I am an independent reviewer and did not receive the product free for my honest review. I cannot recommend this product enough."

It's a perfect size (18 bottles) for a countertop, and can't be heard.  If something changes I will update my review,  but so far, it exceeds expectations.  I would also note that I only use it for reds and the temperature doesn't fluctuate.  Got my money's worth on this product."

This did not come with the item to use the top portion to pour beer, although, they use to sell the item.  They indicated that if I purchase another product (Mini Keg like Heineken) then it will come with the device.  Why should I purchase a beer that I don't like in order to use the product that I purchased from this company.  It's just a cooler....nothing more.

B00FHX9UQK,"Avanti Model DWE1802SS Built-In Dishwasher, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,3,"Didn't realize it was so small, doesn't hold many dishes. Racks are not good, they just aren't designed to hold dishes well. It works, but that's it. I would not recommend it. Plastic racks and silverware holder are chintzy, not durable."
B004MX8XO6,SPT Countertop Dishwasher,Major Appliances,5,"I love my spt countertop dishwasher, it works great and has made my life easier.  When I first got it I had to do some maneuvering of certain dishes to get them to fit but now I know where each one fits best and I have no issues.  I have had my dishwasher for 6 weeks and with a family of 4 I use it at least once a day and I have had no problems with leaking water or dishes still being dirty."

B0052YH4S0,"Bosch SHE3AR56UC Ascenta 24"" Black Full Console Dishwasher - Energy Star",Major Appliances,1,"It's not that the dishwasher does not do its job, or is not functional, but the racks are absolute and utter garbage. Before the wheels on either side started falling off, making it a constant chore to clip them back on, the racks themselves were constantly falling off the tracks. After a while the snap-on side wheels actually began to be less effective in regard to their ability to stay on at all. I actually bought replacement parts with little or no success at keeping this garbage together. Recently the part under the top rack that spins the water snapped off during a cycle. I clipped it back on and the next time we used: same result. All the inside parts of this are cheap plastic junk. I am not sure if it's my job to constantly repair and realign the racks as part of my purchase. Unfortunately I bought this on other reviews on line without seeing it in person. I will never do that again."

B00PYDN0NM,LG LFXS29626S French Door Refrigerator with 29 Cu. Ft. Capacity in Stainless Steel,Major Appliances,5,"We moved into a new house that had a french door fridge.  Never had that style so we were excited to try it out.  What we didn't realize is that the capacity on that one was VERY small.  With 6 kids, it just didn't work for us, but we liked the style.  I found this LG fridge on Amazon and seemed to have great reviews.  I LOVE how big it is  We can put so much food in there it is awesome.  We no longer have to reorganize things to try and free up some space.  The freezer is nice and deep, and the drawer can easily fit a lot of ice cream. :)  The second ice maker in the freezer it awesome.  Living in AZ, it is almost a necessity to always have plenty of ice and have it easily accessible when you need to dump it in a cooler or water jug.<br /><br />Noise level is quiet, but once in a while you'll hear a buzzing, but doesn't seem to last long.  Overall we are have been pretty happy about that.<br /><br />The one complaint is the water dispenser.  I seems pretty slow when trying to fill a cup.  It is also easy to misjudge where to put you cup when you fist use it.  A couple of guests have sprayed water when they first used it with our thicker glass cups.<br /><br />Overall, we are very pleased with it and would buy it again in a heart beat.<br /><br />11/12/2015 - I just discovered the problem with the water dispenser.  It had to do with the water pressure in our house.  Once we got that fixed the water fills cups quickly.  This fridge is perfect for us."
B00ET5VUI8,Liebherr 15.5 Cu. Ft. Freestanding Stainless Steel Counter Depth Bottom Freezer Refrigerator - CS1660,Major Appliances,5,"Overall, I've loved this and would buy it again.  I have read a few reviews and wonder if they are talking about the same item.  Yes, I got two replacement handles which were not hard to replace.  Not really a big deal.  This CS1660 has been in my condo for almost 4 years with no other issues.<br /><br />Pros:  1) Size is amazing for small spaces.  2) Ice Maker:  I can ditch a full tray of ice and before 24 hours has passed, it is full again.  As a single person, I can't keep up.  3) Easy to clean.<br /><br />Cons:  the Handles which had to be replaced.  (Pro: they got them right out to me right away without question.)  2) Only comes in Stainless Steel.  3)  Water Filter is a bit pricy.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy another Liehberr if I moved."

B000FRVV4W,Rotating Dishwasher Magnet by RSVP International,Major Appliances,5,"Contrary to a few of the other reviews here, I had no issues at all with this magnet sticking to my stainless steel dishwasher surface.  (I know that some stainless steel alloys are magnetic and others aren't, and I tested my dishwasher first with a magnet I had on-hand at home).  This magnet is minimalistic in design, and doesn't detract from the smooth steel finish on my appliances.  It rotates easily, and the squiggly-line/straight-line graphical design makes the magnet easy to decipher from across the kitchen.  Now if only I could get my son to pay attention to it!!"

It had some broken parts for the vent system and a missing part. I didn't have the time to send it back to get quite new one because our old one broke and I cook a lot, I needed a ventilation system that worked fast lol. I needed it up the same day.<br /><br />I was quite disappointed with the damaged product when it's supposed to be new and missing component. I had to improvise to get it installed and paid some additional money at home depot to rigashad some parts.<br /><br />Despite my negative experience with this. Once installed, the range hood is quite beautiful and I love the 4 bright blue lights it has. I do wish there was some other settings to dim the lights. It only has one light setting. I've also noticed that the fan on max setting is quite better than average but quite not as strong as I need. I've done some custom work to my kitchen and I have the rangehood about 3+ feet above my stove top. I cook a lot tho :) overall very satisfied with the performance and overall look of the hood. It defiantly is beautiful in the kitchen! The fan isn't that loud on max setting.<br /><br />I would buy this product again.

The GE is significantly bigger, washes better, and much shorter wash cycle (the SPT takes 2 hours vs about 45minutes for the GE!). DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM<br /><br />Despite the trouble getting refunded from the manufacturer, Amazon stepped in and refunded the full amount of the product. Kudos to Amazon for customer support."

B00E82P5OC,LG Graphite 4.5 Cu Ft Front Control Top Load Washer and 7.3 Cu Ft Steam ELECTRIC DRYER WT1201CV_DLEY1201V,Major Appliances,1,Definately not a great washer. Dryer is ok but not any near near as great as it could be. I picked this up at Aaron's which is a type of rent to own place. My first few loads were great. Clothes smelt clean and it was fantastic. Then I noticed it was starting to get louder as I used it. Then mistakably a quarter got washed and all hell broke loose it lodged in the part that spins at the bottom and since now I hear a clicking noise sometimes when the load is spinning. Visually they are attractive however these are practically useless. Needless to say they are both being picked up tomorrow and I'm giving them back to the company. Just bought a kenmore set the 600s . Wish me luck!

B003US9ZS2,"Danby DDW1809W 18"" Built-In Dishwasher - White",Major Appliances,1,I bought a Danby 1809W through amazon on July 19 of 2013. It stopped working exactly three days ago. I would estimate it had handled maybe 100 loads of dishes in total and had been used lightly. I cleaned plates before putting them in and babied the unit. I do  not know about you but when I buy a 400-500 dollar appliance I expect it to work a minimum of five years. I hope to get ten or more years honestly... and most appliances will give you that. My experience with 18 inch dishwashers has been terrible across the board. They cost more than a full size dishwasher and break extremely easily. I just want to warn you... purchase the best and longest extended warranty available if you are considering buying this item.

And my wife hates the features others are complaining about too...the draining and lid and water temp and slow to fill...like it's a 1/4&#34; line!!! Terrible. Had no idea before buying.  The mainreason I bought Whirlpool was because the last set last me 22 years. Of course with some service I performed but after 15 years and not 10 months!!!. The warranty service is becoming difficult and time consuming, and all the while...you guessed it---can't wash a thing. So what now? Buy another and use this one for spare parts? LOL"

B00JEWNKR0,"Estone Waterproof Plastic Electronic Project Box Enclosure Case 3.94"" x 2.68"" x 1.97""",Major Appliances,5,"Just what the doctor ordered, and unavailable anywhere else.  I needed to connect a new string of underwater fountain lights to the 12v cable running underground from the transformer into the pond, so used this box and PG9 Waterproof Cable Glands (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BXWVLNE/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_50) to do the job.  Drilled 5/8-in holes in the sides of the box, fastened the cable glands (with a little silicone just to be sure), spliced the wires, tightened the glands, closed up the box, and everything is working just as desired.<br /><br />Only issue is that with air inside it will float, so I found a nice piece of flagstone to set on top of the box and conceal the wires."
B00DYJNNWQ,"Luma Comfort IM200SS Portable Clear Ice Maker, 28-Pound",Major Appliances,1,"Update:  After day 2 the ice maker no longer works correctly.  The freeze tray gets jammed with very cloudy and oddly shaped ice.  The water pump sounds like it's struggling and the waterflow now comes out sporadically onto the freeze tray. I just returned the unit.  I'm now downgrading my review from 4 stars down to 1 star.   Original review: Was looking for a good machine to supplement the built-in ice maker on our refrigerator. So far the unit has met my expectations. First off, it looks fabulous sitting on the counter. Secondly, it's not noisy.  I was concerned it might be too loud sitting in our kitchen since the living room is next door.  I can barely hear it. It's about on par with the noise of a refrigerator and MUCH more quiet than our dishwasher.  The ice is perfectly clear.  I've been dumping it into a Rubbermaid container that I bought just to fit my freezer. It goes in a bit on the wet side, but completes freezing in the freezer and separates nicely when you twist the container a bit.  On the negative: There's a procedure you can activate to have the unit run three minutes longer for thicker ice.  You turn the unit off, then hold the pwr button for 5 seconds to activate. This would be more intuitive with a separate &#34;thick ice&#34; button.  The current method gives no indication of which mode is active."

But the plastic has completely disintegrated to the point that one of the pull out bins is no longer usable....the glass rack over the bin has fallen apart and there is NO way to fix it....I haven't looked to see what the replacement cost is but I know it's is expensive AND it will just do the same thing again.<br /><br />Very poor design and a very poor refrigerator.  I would never buy another whirlpool again...and I have had good luck with them in the past.  It is so cheap now though that there is NO chance this machine will last for any reasonable length of time.  DO NOT BUY IT."

It has been repaired 3 times in the first year ! Don't mention I had to live with dishwasher that gets MOLD all the time, the lower drawer would  fill up with water from the sink  when not used and  nothing they could do  to stop it.<br />At the end of the cycle the dishes are wet  because there is no heated dry.Large  dinner plates won't fit...<br />Now my dishwasher is less than 2 years old, out of warranty and heating element is failed, need to pay $95 service call + $109  for heating element + $170 labour....to fix it  (Quoted by their authorized service  company) !

In most ways, this product is worse.<br />* The &#34;trim&#34; along the edge is no longer metal, it is plastic<br />* The microwave is no longer flush with the trim.  It is slightly recessed.<br />* The LED display is a darker blue which is noticeably harder to read.  I still have the Whirpool over next to it, and reading the displays side-by-side is a noticeable difference when you want to read the time.  The older, light blue on the oven is more crisp, with more contrast.  The new microwave is blurry with less contrast.<br />* The buttons for the controls are already starting to show wear.  How is this possible?  The old unit never showed signs of wear for pressing buttons, and I have only had this new unit a few months.  The old one lasted for over 3 years.<br />* The unit beeps when it is done cooking something.  Ok.  But it doesn't stop being when you open the door.  That is annoying.  That, and the sound it noticeably louder with the door open.<br />* I often like cooking at less than 100% power.  With this model, I can no longer enter the power level after entering the time.  Instead, I have to remember to press a &#34;cook time&#34; button, then the time to cook, and then the &#34;power level&#34; button will work."

There was no indication that any abuse had occurred on the outside of the box, but two sections of the cabinetry were damaged, as if the unit were dropped prior to packaging. The door is loose fitting and must be pushed a few times after closing to get the mechanics of the unit to operate correctly.

I had to replace the water sensor and assy brake, lucky I'm handy so I was able to repair it myself, but I shouldn't have to replace that on a machine that's only a couple of years old.

B00T6OB50A,"Speed Queen AWN432SP 26"" Top Load Washer with 3.3 cu. ft. Capacity, in White",Major Appliances,2,"I wanted to love this washer after a bad experience with an HE top-loader, but I had to return it due to a back-up of soap bubbles pouring out of the washer hose where it meets the wall (the standpipe) every time I used the machine (see the pic below). Every time I did a load of laundry, a trail of bubbles would leak out of the standpipe and drip onto our wall and behind the machine, causing potential moisture/mold issues. Luckily the retailer agreed to take it back.<br /><br />I called Speed Queen's technical support numerous times and while they were polite and clearly familiar with the problem, they couldn't do anything to fix it. I tried reducing the amount of detergent, trying different types of HE detergent (though this is a traditional agitator-style machine it requires HE detergent), adding a standpipe adapter, but nothing worked. Speed Queen politely insisted the problem must be my plumbing or the location of the standpipe, but out of the 4 washers that have been installed in the exact same set-up in the past 4 months, only the Speed Queen had a bubble problem. Speed Queen said the problem is because their machines (especially the pump) are very powerful, but I don't think that's the case. It seemed to me that bubbles would get trapped in the hose during the rinse/spin cycle, agitate within the house due to some defect until they turned into a lather, and then discharge at the end of the spin cycle in a torrent.<br /><br />Also, though this machine purports to have a best-in-the-business warranty, good luck using that warranty.When I called Speed Queen to see if we could set up a warranty call to see if there was something wrong with our pump or hose, Speed Queen told me to contact the retailer or to look up a local service provider directly. Speed Queen doesn't seem to provide any warranty services, so it is up to your retailer to handle any warranty claims.  In this case, our retailer was going to charge us a $129 service fee if they determined that there was nothing wrong with the machine so we passed on that.<br /><br />Another quirk of this machine is that the Eco Normal cycle uses no hot water even if the machine is set to warm or hot. All Normal washes are cold water only. If you want a warm or hot wash, you have to use the Permanent Press, Delicate or Heavy Duty cycles. Eco Normal also provides no extra rinse option.<br /><br />Luckily our retailer took this back, or else we would have a big problem with the overflowing bubbles. We've had a replacement front-loader for a week now and no bubbles with this one.was nothing wrong with the machine so we passed on that.<br /><br />Another quirk of this machine is that the Eco Normal cycle uses no hot water even if the machine is set to warm or hot.

Samsung sent two different repair guys out within 2 months to &#34;fix&#34; the ice. The first guy did something that momentarily fixed it. Then it started not doing cubes again... Until the second repair guy came. Murphy's Law, right? At that point we were past the one year warranty. Now, 3 years later, the WATER AND ICE DISPENSER IS COMPLETELY NOT WORKING!!!!

When washing delicates, use a lower time setting, because it really agitates the clothing. The washing machine came in just three days, however, the box was busted open and the machine was literally hanging out.  The bottom of the machine was cracked in several places, and with a big hole; clearly a shipping issue.  I took a chance to see if would function and it ran okay, but it leaked water all over the floor.

It's like it's stuck on a cycle where it just stops making the inside cold. It continues to report the temperature for hours, or days later. I will notice it at 65 degrees! Why? Battery voltage is full, set temp is 40, it is completely ON and plugged in. I need to unplug the power and plug it back in for the system to function normally again and cool down the fridge to the set temp. Until some time later in the week...

I am not even going to call a repair technician this time, not worth sinking any more money into this horrible machine, which is only a year and a half old.  I do not know what caused it to leak but I know that it will cost me hundreds of dollars to find out, and I'll still have a machine that constantly is unbalanced, that just adds water over and over to try to balance ( and yes we have used the level and made sure the machine was level).  You can't do a small load, you can't do a big load, you can't wash your kids athletic jackets or a mattress pad because it can't handle anything with waterproof fabric.  I can't reach the wet laundry in it without standing on a stool and using the extra long tongs I had to buy just for this purpose.  Owning a water- and time- and energy-saving device should not require this much extra water, time, and energy -- I am beyond frustrated.  This is the worst appliance purchase we have ever made.

B00G9EHGDK,Panda Small Compact Portable Washing Machine Pan30 Drain By Gravity,Major Appliances,5,I am so glad that I found this awesome little machine. No more trekking laundry to give someone else my hard earned money. I just received my Panda today and put it though a test. I decided the day I ordered my Panda that I was going to let my laundry build up and not go to the coin op. It took six days to arrive. So I had a weeks worth of socks undies at ten t_shirts and eight jeans.Well I did all the socks and undies together in one load.  Two pair of jeans apiece. And I was able to do five t-shirts. At a time. This machine is great. It got the job done. It is quite while washing and when it was in the spin cycle I almost forgot it was running I had to get up and check it just to find that it was on. As for drying I hung everything on a drying rack and put a fan on to circulate some air and by the time I started washing my shirts most of the socks and undies were already dry. The shirts took about 45 mins to dry. And the jeans they took just a little while to dry about 2 hours to be completely dry. Not bad for this sweet little thing. I love it one of the best purchases that I've made. If you live in a small apartment where you don't have washer hook ups this is perfect. Its also just the right size for an RV or one of the reasons I got it I'm going to use it on my sailboat when I cruise the ICW next year.

B0055UBB4O,Danby 0.7 cu.ft. Countertop Microwave,Major Appliances,5,"Love this microwave.  It fit perfectly in the area I wanted it to.  I wanted a simple, smaller microwave and this fit the bill.  Most microwaves are larger and have too many bells and whistles for me.  It is very attractive - I wanted some stainless to match my other appliances.  I have another Danby product (dehumidifier) and find Danby to be a good product.  In one review I read it said the microwave slid when opening the door - I haven't found this to be a problem at all.  The price for this is great.  Would definitely recommend it."
B00KVMEFMQ,"SPT SD-2202S Countertop Dishwasher with Delay Start, Silver",Major Appliances,5,Bought this dishwasher for my apartment. It was very easy to install. However I did need to shave one of the rubber washers down to fit my specific faucet. But I am more than impressed by how clean my dishes have come out. I have used it twice so far ( without rinse aid because i forgot to buy it at the store) and the dishes are cleaner than I have ever been able to get them by hand. The unit isn't much bigger than a microwave and really surpassed my expectations. 5 star all day errrrrrday.   *Update* it's been about 2 weeks since I got the dishwasher I've used it everyday (sometimes more than once a day) and it's still going strong. My only regret is not buying this thing sooner. I literally spend maybe 5 minutes doing dishes now as compared to 20+ minutes by hand. There's so much time for activities now.

B00BB4INY4,Whirlpool WRS325FDAM 25.4 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Side-By-Side Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,2,"After 10 months owning this fridge, we have consistently had issues with the icemaker.  I learned that for crushed ice, you have to push your cup all the way back into the chute opener to avoid it spraying all over the kitchen.  It does still drop ice cubes randomly on the floor even when you're not standing there.  Now we have a new problem.  For some reason, the ice bucket part is breaking, leaving sharp, jagged edged pieces of plastic and lots of ice cubes falling down into the frozen food area which then fall all over my beautiful wood floor and go everywhere when we open the freezer door.  I guess the fridge is okay otherwise, but the leftovers and fresh fruits and vegetables go bad very fast.  Reading the other reviews, I'll need to purchase a thermometer to check the cooling. Knowing all this, I would never advise anyone to buy this model."

The manual's instructions if this happens is to &#34;fix the hoses&#34; and I'm not sure what that means. I tried unplugging and plugging them in again, several times, unscrewing and screwing everything that can be. As things stand, I'm extremely disappointed at having this huge thing in my kitchen that I can't use and paid 200+ dollars for. Even if it is fixed eventually, I'm very disappointed because I thought this was supposed to be a straightforward install."

The fan gets frozen by ice very easily and I was told by the GE service guy all I need to do is to unplug the refrigerator for 48 hours so that the ice will melt and the fan can get back to work.  It's a little bit over 2 years old and my tenant now is complaining about leaking water.  A lot of food has been wasted.  I bought it from the Home Depot in November/December 2011.

It cleans the dishes very well - including our daughter's sippy cups. Anyone who knows how annoying it is to clean sippy cups needs this dishwasher, or any dishwasher at all.

I finally put the old filter back in and it worked perfectly.  The original manufacturer's filter and this filter look exactly the same, but the original works, while the replacement fails to work period.  I am highly disappointed and extremely glad that I only ordered one filter instead of a multi-filter package.  What a waste of money."

B00EHL6TJY,"SPT SD-9241SS Energy Star Portable Dishwasher, 18-Inch, Stainless Steel",Major Appliances,1,"After working perfectly for several months, this dishwasher has inexplicably begun giving us an error code that translates to low water pressure. The pressure from the faucet is unchanged has been tested following this problem showing itself and is right where it should be for the dishwasher. Hoses are clear, can hear water run, but then error code 2 mins into cycle and stops.<br /><br />Additional information: Contacted VirVentures and Amazon directly about this defective unit, both refuse to do anything at all to remedy this situation. Then contacted manufacturer and despite a claim in their warranty that &#34;customer will never pay for repairs&#34; quite the opposite is true, as they quickly ask for $125 for shipping, which from my perspective is most certainly me paying for repair. For the record, this dishwasher will be taken to the dump at the next opportunity.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are willing to pay $500 for  3 months of dishes being done, then this is a great bet. If you want a durable dishwasher that you can count on, go to Home Depot. Their return policy on defective items is much better."

B00FRJ5EWS,2016 Life Water Ionizer Next Generation M9 Counter-top,Major Appliances,5,"We purchased this ionizer after doing a lot of research.  It seems like there are a lot of companies out there that are not very good.  So just to be safe we got the pitcher of life first (a more affordable option made by the same company).  It worked GREAT.  After using the pitcher of life for awhile we felt good about this company and decided to invest in an ionizer, we have been very happy.  We are sold and do not plan on ever going back to regular water.  Let me describe then what I mean by its &#34;working great&#34;.  I have had Gout for the last 18 years, and it have been in constant pain due to this illness for the last 5.  Been working with my doctor and taking meds to relieve this pain and there has been some relief.  after starting on the pitcher of life and then going to the M9, the pain has been completely gone, and my blood levels show a complete normalization of my uric acid levels.  By no means stop seeing your doctor and stop taking anything prescribed, that's not what I did, but in addition to everything the doctor said I did this, and it helped.  I have been pain free from gout since one week after starting this.  One word of warning though, I went through a week of PAIN after starting drinking ionized water, its just the nature of Gout it gets worse before it gets better.  One week of pain then nothing no more pain ever again.  I stand behind this company specifically, like i said we did a lot of research on the ionizer companies and this one seems like the best.  We are every happy.  The acid water is great for dusting, it just dissolves the dust.  Also the plants love the high PH we water the plants at a PH of 11, and they have been thriving."

B00471OP0E,Washer,Major Appliances,1,"This could be a good machine, but too many extraneous features make it substandard. First off, once you press &#34;start&#34; you can forget any changes to water temp., load size, numbers of rinse cycles, etc. There is no soak feature. I solved this by filling up the machine, putting in the clothes, giving it 2 minutes washing, then I unplug it and soak for a while. The absolute worst feature is the locked lid. Once the cycle begins the lid is locked, and you have to press &#34;pause&#34; and hold for three seconds, which allows you to open the lid if you want to add soap or more clothes, etc. The ABSOLUTE worst feature is the locked lid. If you should leave the lid open and tub has filled with water, the machine automatically drains the water. What a WASTE of water. I finally disabled the catch on the lid that locks it. Now I run the machine while never closing the lid. I have to remember to reinsert the clip so the machine will reset at the end of the cycle. I'd love to have my old Maytag back that I bought in '93. I could do anything with that tank. When this new Whirlpool machine was delivered, the truck driver carried the new machine into the garage without any assistance or handtruck. With great difficulty, the same driver put the old Maytag on a handtruck and wheeled it off. The Maytag probably weighed twice as much as the Whirlpool. He said I'd be lucky to get 5 years' service from the Whirlpool."
B00CXNC5XM,KitchenAid KFIV29PCMS Architect II 28.6 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel French Door Refrigerator - Energy Star,Major Appliances,1,I purchased a Kitchen Aid refrigerator and have regretted it from day 1.  Do yourself a favor and look at other brands.  Kitchen Aid does not stand behind their appliances.  They should stick with mixers and need some serious help resolving customer complaints.  My refrigerator is 2 years old and has stopped working 3 times!!  I now have a $3k kitchen ornament and have resorted to using a Kenmore mini fridge until it is fixed again!!
B001PAWUWK,NEW Replacement Part - Frigidaire Washer Drain pump assembly Part# 134051200,Major Appliances,1,"This pump worked for only two loads of laundry before the front bearing assembly separated from the pump housing causing the rotor in the motor to bind up. After disassembling the pump I found that the only thing holding it in place is the front rubber seal. After several attempts at putting it back together ( all resulting in the same failure) I was able to epoxy the pump bearing assembly to the housing and it has so far been working fine. Due to my background in appliance repair I was able to make it work but, most consumers will not be able to use this pump as it is sold out of the box. If you don't have the ability to troubleshoot, modify, and or repair appliances this is not an item I can recommend. If you do purchase it I would recommend taking the unit apart and using a good quality epoxy to permanently adhere the front bearing assembly to the pump housing ( as your original pump would have been). I am sure I am not the only consumer to have had this issue as it is not a very good design out of the box."

Then the drawer below the two crisper drawers became very difficult to open and close.  I thought something was stuck in the back.  Oh Nooooo, there was a sheet of ice 1 inch thick under the drawer.  The ice maker had already quit making ice, but I did not realize the water was building up under the drawer.  The same problem everyone else has had.  It will cost nearly $600 to fix it with service call, part, and labor charges.  I think I better get a new refrigerator.  I have an old Amana in the garage that is probably a power guzzler, but nothing has ever gone wrong with it!

It failed after 14 months some sort of drain motor failure.  This dishwasher was replacing a noisy 15 year old model, I thought nah don't need the extended warranty. It will last. Boy was I wrong.  The only good thing was it was quiet.  Poorly designed upper racks, poor quality workmanship that lasts just a year when it goes out of warranty.  It is not a brand I will trust ever.  Not to mention when I contacted Samsung all they wanted to do was sell me the extended protection.  They did not stand behind the poor quality of their product.  If I could give negative stars I would. It's that bad."
